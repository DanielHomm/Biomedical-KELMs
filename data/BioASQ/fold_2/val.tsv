1	55262a9787ecba3764000009	Is RANKL secreted from the cells?	Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a soluble secreted factor that acts as a decoy receptor for receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL)  Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a secreted glycoprotein and a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. It usually functions in bone remodeling, by inhibiting osteoclastogenesis through interaction with a receptor activator of the nuclear factor κB (RANKL). e RANKL/OPG ratio secreted by osteoblasts increased and RANK expression by osteoclasts increased, leading to increased osteoclastogenesis Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is an essential secreted protein in bone turnover due to its role as a decoy receptor for the Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kB ligand (RANKL) in the osteoclasts, thus inhibiting their differentiation We identify a TNFSF11 transcript variant that extends the originally identified transcript encoding secreted RANKL. Activated human T cells express alternative mRNA transcripts encoding a secreted form of RANKL. OPG, on the other hand, is secreted by osteoblast as a decoy receptor for RANKL, prevents RANKL from binding to RANK and thus prevents bone resorption Receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are cytokines predominantly secreted by osteoblasts and play a central role in differentiation and functional activation of osteoclasts Although B. abortus-activated T cells actively secreted the pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines RANKL and IL-17, osteoclastogenesis depended on IL-17, because osteoclast generation induced by Brucella-activated T cells was completely abrogated when these cells were cultured with BMMs from IL-17 receptor knockout mice.   osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction in autoimmune arthritis. We isolated human fibroblasts from RA, pyrophosphate arthropathy (PPA) and osteoarthritis (OA) patients and analyzed their RANKL/OPG expression profile and the capacity of their secreted factors to induce osteoclastogenesis.

A Phase 2 Study of Concurrent Radiation Therapy, Temozolomide, and the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Valproic Acid for Patients With Glioblastoma. PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) cells to radiation in preclinical models.  Median overall survival (OS) was 29.6 months (range: 21-63.8 months), and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.5 months (range: 6.8-51.2 months). OS at 6, 12, and 24 months was 97%, 86%, and 56%, respectively. PFS at 6, 12, and 24 months was 70%, 43%, and 38% respectively.  CONCLUSIONS: Addition of VPA to concurrent RT/TMZ in patients with newly diagnosed GBM was well tolerated. Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study. Treatment of GDSCs with histone deacetylase inhibitors, TSA and VPA, significantly reduced proliferation rates of the cells and expression of the stem cell markers, indicating differentiation of the cells. Since differentiation into GBM makes them susceptible to the conventional cancer treatments, we posit that use of histone deacetylase inhibitors may increase efficacy of the conventional cancer treatments for eliminating GDSCs. Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients.  Our meta-analysis confirmed the benefit of using VPA (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.44-0.71). Sub-group analysis shows that patients treated with VPA had a hazard ratio of 0.74 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.59-0.94 vs. patients treated by other-AEDs and a hazard ratio of 0.66 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.52-0.84 vs. patients treated by administration of non-AEDs.  .CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that glioblastoma patients may experience prolonged survival due to VPA administration.  A new and exciting insight is the potential contribution of VPA to prolonged survival, particularly in glioblastomas.  Valproic acid (VPA) is an antiepileptic agent with histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) activity shown to sensitize glioblastoma (GBM) cells to radiation in preclinical models Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT) Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival. Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma. PURPOSE: Valproic acid (VA) is an antiepileptic drug (AED) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor taken by patients with glioblastoma (GB) to manage seizures, and it can modulate the biologic effects of radiation therapy (RT). We investigated whether VA use during RT for GB was associated with overall survival (OS).METHODS AND MATERIALS: Medical records of 544 adults with GB were retrospectively reviewed. Analyses were performed to determine the association of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis (RTOG RPA) class, seizure history, and concurrent temozolomide (TMZ) and AED use during RT with OS.RESULTS: Seizures before the end of RT were noted in 217 (40%) patients, and 403 (74%) were taking an AED during RT; 29 (7%) were taking VA.  When the analysis was restricted to patients who received concurrent TMZ, VA use was marginally associated with OS (P=.057; HR, 0.54; 95% CI, -0.09 to 1.17), independently of RTOG RPA class and seizure history. Patients using VPA in combination with temozolomide showed a longer median survival of 69 weeks (95% confidence interval [CI]: 61.7-67.3) compared with 61 weeks (95% CI: 52.5-69.5) in the group without VPA (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43-0.92; P = .016), adjusting for age, extent of resection, and O(6)-DNA methylguanine-methyltransferase promoter methylation status. Use of VPA together with chemoradiation with temozolomide results in a 2-months' longer survival of patients with GBM.	yes
25	530e42e65937551c09000007	Is fatigue prevalent in patients receiving treatment for glioblastoma?	By contrast, fatigue worsened over time, with a difference in mean score of 5.6 points between baseline and 4-month follow-up (P=.02). In the GB cohort, the most common side effects were fatigue (56 %), diarrhea (44 %), neutropenia (31 %), and thrombocytopenia (25 %).  A total of 37 patients were treated, and treatment was well tolerated: grade 3, 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred in 30% of patients and consisted mainly of fatigue (14%) and neuropathy (5%); grade 3, 4 hematologic toxicity occurred in 37% of patients and consisted of thrombocytopenia (30%), lymphopenia (4%), and neutropenia (4%).  Nonhematologic Grade 3 toxicity was rare, and included fatigue in 4 patients and cognitive disability in 1 patient. The most common grade 3 events were neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, and infection in 25, 20, 13, and 10%, respectively.  Analysis of the results of the VAS Norris scale did not demonstrate an increase in emotional fatigue but did show an increase in physical fatigue that did not reach statistical significance. With regards to the MFI 20 tool, analysis of the results demonstrated a significant increase in general (P=0.0260) as well as physical (P=0.0141) fatigue but there was no difference in the other indices. This study demonstrated a progressive increase in physical fatigue in patients with glioblastoma relapse treated with irinotecan-bevacizumab.  One patient treated with temozolomide plus isotretinoin plus thalidomide had dose-limiting grade 3 fatigue and rash, and 1 patient receiving all 4 agents had dose-limiting grade 4 neutropenia.  The toxicities observed were primarily grade 1 and 2, and the most common were fatigue, hypertension, and headache.  Fatigue (41%), rash (62%), and loose stools (58%) constituted the most frequent adverse events, the majority of these being limited to Grade 1/2.  The most common grades 3 and 4 nonhematologic toxicities were nausea/vomiting (6.7%) and fatigue (5.8%).  Grade 3/4 toxicities included leukopenia (n = 1), lymphopenia (n = 2), thrombocytopenia (n = 1), ALT elevation (n = 3), AST elevation (n = 1), CNS hemorrhage (n = 1), fatigue (n = 1), and thrombotic/embolic events (n = 3); 8 patients required dose reduction.  The most common grade 3 or greater adverse events were fatigue (7%), neutropaenia (7%), and thrombocytopaenia (7%). Bevacizumab-related toxicity included fatigue (16 patients; 4 grade 3), leukopenia (9; 1 grade 3), anemia (5; 0 grade 3), hypertension (7; 1 grade 3), deep vein thrombosis (4; 1 grade 3) and wound dehiscence (2; 1 grade 3).  Tiredness may be caused by the brain injury due to the tumor or the treatment in patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Some patients describe a sense of tiredness particularly after radiation or oral chemotherapy. Levels of tiredness in patients with GBM were greatly affected by the radiotherapy and oral chemotherapy (temozolomide). The treatment had no negative effect on HRQOL, however, fatigue (P = 0.02) and constipation (P = 0.01) scales worsened over time.  This regimen was well tolerated with grade 3/4 toxicities of fatigue, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and rash requiring dose reductions.  The most common atrasentan-related toxicities were grade 1 or 2 rhinitis, fatigue, and edema. One patient developed Grade IV fatigue at the 100 ng/mL dose, but the MTD has not been established.  Side-effects in all patients have included varying degrees of anorexia, fatigue, ipsilateral forehead dermatitis, blepharitis, and conjunctivitis.   Some patients suffered from fatigue and weak concentration about three months after the end of radiotherapy, in some cases even the neurologic state was deteriorated.  grade 1-2 common toxicities included fever, chills, fatigue, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and headache, neutrophilia and skin painful reactions appeared regularly at levels 3 and 4 (2.5 mg and 3.5 mg).  Ten episodes of grade 3/4 adverse events were observed in nine patients, including fatigue (n = 3), thrombocytopenia (n = 4), and myelotoxicity, febrile neutropenia, and pulmonary embolism (each n = 1). Common adverse events were CTCAE grade 1-2 fatigue, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and nausea. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were venous thrombosis, fatigue, skin reactions, encephalopathy, and neuropathy.	yes
39	5311cdcce3eabad021000007	Is there any software for automated analysis of FISH images?	he study demonstrated the feasibility of automated FISH signal analysis that applying a CAD scheme to the automated generated 2-D projection images. A color imaging technique, multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization (M-FISH), has been developed to ease the analysis of the process. Using an M-FISH technique each chromosome class (1,2, …,22,X,Y) is stained with a unique color. However, significant variations between images are observed due to a number of factors such as uneven hybridization and spectral overlap among channels. These types of variations influence the pixel classification accuracy of image classification methods which are supervised and require a set of annotated images for training. In this paper, we present a fully unsupervised M-FISH chromosome image classification methodology. Our main contributions are 1) the assumption that the intensity of a chromosome pixel is sampled from multiple Gaussian components [Gaussian mixture model (GMM)] such that each component corresponds to one chromosome class, and 2) the initialization of the GMM model using the emission information of each chromosome class. This is feasible since prior to the M-FISH image acquirement, we already know which chromosome class is emitting to each of the five M-FISH image channels. The method has been tested on a large number of M-FISH images and an overall accuracy of 89.85% is reported. Our method is unsupervised and presents higher classification accuracy even when it is compared with common supervised based methods. hybridization (FISH) tests provide promising molecular imaging biomarkers to more accurately and reliably detect and diagnose cancers and genetic disorders. Since current manual FISH signal analysis is low-efficient and inconsistent, which limits its clinical utility, developing automated FISH image scanning systems and computer-aided detection (CAD) schemes has been attracting research interests. To acquire high-resolution FISH images in a multi-spectral scanning mode, a huge amount of image data with the stack of the multiple three-dimensional (3-D) image slices is generated from a single specimen. Automated preprocessing these scanned images to eliminate the non-useful and redundant data is important to make the automated FISH tests acceptable in clinical applications. In this study, a dual-detector fluorescence image scanning system was applied to scan four specimen slides with FISH-probed chromosome X. A CAD scheme was developed to detect analyzable interphase cells and map the multiple imaging slices recorded FISH-probed signals into the 2-D projection images. CAD scheme was then applied to each projection image to detect analyzable interphase cells using an adaptive multiple-threshold algorithm, identify FISH-probed signals using a top-hat transform, and compute the ratios between the normal and abnormal cells. To assess CAD performance, the FISH-probed signals were also independently visually detected by an observer. The Kappa coefficients for agreement between CAD and observer ranged from 0.69 to 1.0 in detecting/counting FISH signal spots in four testing samples.  In this paper we developed a sparse representation-based classification (SRC) algorithm based on L1-norm minimization for classifying chromosomes from multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) images. The algorithm has been tested on a comprehensive M-FISH database that we established, demonstrating improved performance in classification. When compared with other pixel-wise M-FISH image classifiers such as fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithms and adaptive fuzzy c-means (AFCM) clustering algorithms that we proposed earlier the current method gave the lowest classification error. In order to evaluate the performance of different SRC for M-FISH imaging analysis, three different sparse representation methods, namely, Homotopy method, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), and Least Angle Regression (LARS), were tested and compared. Results from our statistical analysis have shown that Homotopy based method is significantly better than the other two methods.  Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to study the organization and the positioning of specific DNA sequences within the cell nucleus. Analyzing the data from FISH images is a tedious process that invokes an element of subjectivity. Automated FISH image analysis offers savings in time as well as gaining the benefit of objective data analysis. While several FISH image analysis software tools have been developed, they often use a threshold-based segmentation algorithm for nucleus segmentation. As fluorescence signal intensities can vary significantly from experiment to experiment, from cell to cell, and within a cell, threshold-based segmentation is inflexible and often insufficient for automatic image analysis, leading to additional manual segmentation and potential subjective bias. To overcome these problems, we developed a graphical software tool called FISH Finder to automatically analyze FISH images that vary significantly. By posing the nucleus segmentation as a classification problem, compound Bayesian classifier is employed so that contextual information is utilized, resulting in reliable classification and boundary extraction. This makes it possible to analyze FISH images efficiently and objectively without adjustment of input parameters. Additionally, FISH Finder was designed to analyze the distances between differentially stained FISH probes. The simultaneous detection of protein expression and gene copy number changes in patient samples, like paraffin-embedded tissue sections, is challenging since the procedures of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (FISH) negatively influence each other which often results in suboptimal staining. Therefore, we developed a novel automated algorithm based on relocation which allows subsequent detection of protein content and gene copy number changes within the same cell. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded tissue sections of colorectal cancers were stained for CD133 expression. IHC images were acquired and image coordinates recorded. Slides were subsequently hybridized with fluorescently labeled DNA probes. FISH images were taken at the previously recorded positions allowing for direct comparison of protein expression and gene copy number signals within the same cells/tissue areas. Relocation, acquisition of the IHC and FISH images, and enumeration of FISH signals in the immunophenotyped tumour areas were done in an automated fashion. RESULTS: Automated FISH analysis was performed on 13 different colon cancer samples that had been stained for CD133; each sample was scored for MYC, ZNF217 and Chromosome 6 in CD133 positive and negative glands. From the 13 cases four (31%) showed amplification for the MYC oncogene and seven of 13 (54%) cases were amplified for ZNF217.

58	56b8f28a156496395c000006	Is there any association between Jarid2 and miR-155 in Th17 cells?	Jarid2 links MicroRNA and chromatin in Th17 cells. In this issue of Immunity, Escobar et al. (2014) bring microRNAs and chromatin together by showing how activation-induced miR-155 targets the chromatin protein Jarid2 to regulate proinflammatory cytokine production in T helper 17 cells. miR-155 activates cytokine gene expression in Th17 cells by regulating the DNA-binding protein Jarid2 to relieve polycomb-mediated repression. Mir155 was bound by Th17 cell transcription factors and was highly expressed during Th17 cell differentiation. miR-155-deficient Th17 and T regulatory (Treg) cells expressed increased amounts of Jarid2, a DNA-binding protein that recruits the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) to chromatin. PRC2 binding to chromatin and H3K27 histone methylation was increased in miR-155-deficient cells, coinciding with failure to express Il22, Il10, Il9, and Atf3. Defects in Th17 cell cytokine expression and Treg cell homeostasis in the absence of Mir155 could be partially suppressed by Jarid2 deletion. Thus, miR-155 contributes to Th17 cell function by suppressing the inhibitory effects of Jarid2. Thus, miR-155 contributes to Th17 cell function by suppressing the inhibitory effects of Jarid2.

67	5316111fb166e2b806000001	Is oxidative stress affected by FOXO expression?	Forkhead-box class O (FoxO) transcription factors regulate mechanisms of cellular aging, including protein quality control, autophagy and defenses against oxidative stress. Statin-mediated upregulation of klotho expression and differential regulation of FoxO expression promote resistance to CsA-induced oxidative stress. FoxO expression suppressed the ROS-induced apoptosis in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells via the expression of ROS-scavenging enzymes. Differential expression of FOXO1 and FOXO3a confers resistance to oxidative cell death upon endometrial decidualization. We demonstrate that human endometrial stromal cells become extraordinarily resistant to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis upon decidualization in response to cAMP and progesterone signaling. This differentiation process is associated with the induction of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1, which in turn increases the expression of the mitochondrial antioxidant manganese superoxide dismutase. Comparative analysis demonstrated that hydrogen peroxide, a source of free radicals, strongly induces FOXO3a mRNA and protein expression in undifferentiated human endometrial stromal cells but not in decidualized cells. These results suggest that the induction of FOXO1 may enhance the ability of decidualized cells to prevent oxidative damage while the simultaneous repression of FOXO3a expression disables the signaling pathway responsible for oxidative cell death. The differential regulation of FOXO expression provides the decidua with a robust system capable of coping with prolonged episodes of oxidative stress during pregnancy.	yes
76	54cf4a0ef693c3b16b00000c	Is pregabalin effective for treatment of patients with restless leg syndrome?	CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated improvements in objective and subjective measures of sleep maintenance and sleep architecture with pregabalin compared with placebo and pramipexole. Effects of pregabalin on periodic limb movement arousal index were comparable to pramipexole.  CONCLUSIONS: Pregabalin provided significantly improved treatment outcomes as compared with placebo, and augmentation rates were significantly lower with pregabalin than with 0.5 mg of pramipexole. The alpha-2-delta ligands, including gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin, are effective for RLS without known occurrence of augmentation or impulse control disorders, although sedation and dizziness can occur.  Pregabalin has been established as effective for up to 1 year in treating RLS/WED (Level A evidence).  In the group of anticonvulsants, only the trials performed with α₂δ ligands such as gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin showed good efficacy.  Alternative or additional pharmacologic treatment with a lower level of overall quality of evidence includes opioids (codeine, tramadol, and oxycodone) and anticonvulsants (gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin).  There is sufficient evidence to conclude that dopamine agonists such as rotigotine transdermal patch, pramipexole, ropinirole, gabapentin enacarbil, pregabalin and gabapentin are effective in the short-term treatment of RLS and rotigotine, followed by gabapentin enacarbil, ropinirole, pramipexole and gabapentin for long-term treatment. Calcium channel alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin) provide alternative therapies for RLS especially in patients with augmentation, impulse control disorders, or hypersomnia induced by dopamine agonists.  Alpha-2-delta ligands (gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin, and pregabalin) increased the number of IRLS responders (RR=1.66; [95% CI: 1.33 to 2.09], k=3, high strength of evidence) and mean change in IRLS symptom scores (k=3, high strength of evidence).  RECOMMENDATIONS: Level A recommendations can be made for rotigotine, ropinirole, pramipexole, gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin and pregabalin, which are all considered effective for the short-term treatment for RLS. Therapies with an OPTION level of recommendation include carbamazepine, gabapentin, pregabalin, clonidine, and for patients with low ferritin levels, iron supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: In this 6-week phase 2b study, pregabalin reduced RLS symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe idiopathic RLS CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that pregabalin is effective for the treatment of restless legs syndrome and improves sleep architecture and periodic limb movements in placebo-unresponsive patients. In severe, refractory or neuropathy-associated RLS, antiepileptic (gabapentin, pregabalin) or opioid (oxycodone, tramadol) drugs can be used. The alpha-2-delta ligands, including gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, and pregabalin, are effective for RLS without known occurrence of augmentation or impulse control disorders, although sedation and dizziness can occur This study provides Class II evidence that pregabalin is effective for the treatment of restless legs syndrome and improves sleep architecture and periodic limb movements in placebo-unresponsive patients. Level A recommendations can be made for rotigotine, ropinirole, pramipexole, gabapentin enacarbil, gabapentin and pregabalin, which are all considered effective for the short-term treatment for RLS	yes
84	51588c34d24251bc05000095	Is TREM2 associated with Alzheimer's disease in humans?	Genetic deficits and loss of function for the triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM2; encoded at chr6p21.1), a transmembrane spanning stimulatory receptor of the immunoglobulin/lectin-like gene superfamily, have been associated with deficiencies in phagocytosis and the innate immune system in Alzheimer's disease. Recent works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), possible involvement of TREM2 in AD pathogenesis. TREM2 is associated with the risk of Alzheimer's disease in Spanish population. Two recent studies have reported the association of rs75932628-T in the TREM2 gene with the risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). we report the first positive replication study in a Spanish population and confirm that TREM2 rs75932628-T is associated with the risk for AD. (TREM2) has recently been identified as a rare risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study we examined the association between TREM2 exon 2 variants and early-onset AD in a sample of Caucasian subjects of French origin including 726 patients with age of onset ≤65 years and 783 controls. We found significantly more variants in exon 2 of TREM2 in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in controls in the discovery set The most commonly associated variant, rs75932628 (encoding R47H), showed highly significant association with Alzheimer's disease (P<0.001). Our findings strongly implicate variant TREM2 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Given the reported antiinflammatory role of TREM2 in the brain, the R47H substitution may lead to an increased predisposition to Alzheimer's disease Recent works have demonstrated a rare functional variant (R47H) in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) 2 gene, encoding TREM2 protein, increase susceptibility to late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), with an odds ratio similar to that of the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele. The rs75932628-T variant of the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) has recently been identified as a rare risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACKGROUND: Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TREM2, encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 protein, have previously been associated with an autosomal recessive form of early-onset dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous rare variants in TREM2 are associated with a significant increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: A rare missense mutation (rs75932628-T) in the gene encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which was predicted to result in an R47H substitution, was found to confer a significant risk of Alzheimer's disease in Iceland (odds ratio, 2.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.09 to 4.09; P=3.42×10(-10)).	yes
94	553f8bc11d53b76422000002	Are there any functional differences between Mfd and its human Cocaine syndrome protein B (CSB) homolog?	In humans, the TCR coupling factor, CSB, plays a critical role in restoring transcription following both UV-induced and oxidative DNA damage. It also contributes indirectly to the global repair of some forms of oxidative DNA damage. The Escherichia coli homolog, Mfd, is similarly required for TCR of UV-induced lesions. Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage. CSB has an ATPase activity that is stimulated strongly by DNA; however, it neither acts as a helicase nor does it dissociate stalled RNA polymerase II, suggesting a coupling mechanism in humans different from that in prokaryotes.  In addition, these findings imply that Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage. In addition, these findings imply that Mfd may be functionally distinct from its human CSB homolog in that it does not detectably contribute to the recovery of gene expression or global repair following oxidative damage. In contrast, no difference was detected in the rate of transcription recovery in mfd, uvrA, fpg, nth, or polB dinB umuDC mutants relative to wild-type cells following oxidative damage	yes

122	56cc947b5795f9a73e000033	Can SUMO affect calcium homeostasis?	Increasing SUMOylation levels correlated inversely with calcium influx in sensory neurons. CRMP2 deSUMOylation by SUMO proteases SENP1 and SENP2 normalized calcium influx to those in the CRMP2AAA mutant. Thus, our results identify a novel role for SUMO modification in CRMP2/CaV2.2 signaling pathway Moreover, SUMO1 overexpression in isolated cardiomyocytes augmented contractility and accelerated Ca(2+) decay.  RIM1α SUMOylation at lysine residue K502 facilitates the clustering of CaV2.1 calcium channels and enhances the Ca(2+) influx necessary for vesicular release, whereas non-SUMOylated RIM1α participates in the docking/priming of synaptic vesicles and maintenance of active zone structure.  Identification and characterization of a SUMO-1 conjugation system that modifies neuronal calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II in Drosophila melanogaster.	yes
126	532aad53d6d3ac6a34000010	Is there a crystal structure of the full-length of the flaviviridae NS5(Methyltransferase - RNA depended RNA Polymerase) ?	 flavivirus NS5 harbors a methyltransferase (MTase) in its N-terminal ≈ 265 residues and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) within the C-terminal part. One of the major interests and challenges in NS5 is to understand the interplay between RdRP and MTase as a unique natural fusion protein in viral genome replication and cap formation. Here, we report the first crystal structure of the full-length flavivirus NS5 from Japanese encephalitis virus.  (DENV) nonstructural protein 5 (NS5) is composed of two globular domains separated by a 10-residue linker. The N-terminal domain participates in the synthesis of a mRNA cap 1 structure ((7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)) at the 5' end of the viral genome and possesses guanylyltransferase, guanine-N7-methyltransferase, and nucleoside-2'O-methyltransferase activities. The C-terminal domain is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase responsible for viral RNA synthesis. Although crystal structures of the two isolated domains have been obtained, there are no structural data for full-length NS5. It is also unclear whether the two NS5 domains interact with each other to form a stable structure in which the relative orientation of the two domains is fixed. To investigate the structure and dynamics of DENV type 3 NS5 in solution, we conducted small-angle X-ray scattering experiments with the full-length protein. NS5 was found to be monomeric and well-folded under the conditions tested. West Nile virus (WNV) NS5 protein contains a methyltransferase (MTase) domain involved in RNA capping and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain essential for virus replication. Crystal structures of individual WNV MTase and RdRp domains have been solved; however, the structure of full-length NS5 has not been determined. To gain more insight into the structure of NS5 and interactions between the MTase and RdRp domains, we generated a panel of seven monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the NS5 protein of WNV (Kunjin strain) and mapped their binding sites using a series of truncated NS5 proteins and synthetic peptides. Binding sites of four mAbs (5D4, 4B6, 5C11 and 6A10) were mapped to residues 354-389 in the fingers subdomain of the RdRp. This is consistent with the ability of these mAbs to inhibit RdRp activity in vitro and suggests that this region represents a potential target for RdRp inhibitors. Using a series of synthetic peptides, we also identified a linear epitope (bound by mAb 5H1) that mapped to a 13 aa stretch surrounding residues 47 and 49 in the MTase domain, a region predicted to interact with the palm subdomain of the RdRp. The failure of one mAb (7G6) to bind both N- and C-terminally truncated NS5 recombinants indicates that the antibody recognizes a conformational epitope that requires the presence of residues in both the MTase and RdRp domains. 	yes
127	56cf32e23975bb303a000006	Can venlafaxine block NET and SERT?	Treatment for 14 days with 70 mg/kg per day venlafaxine, which inhibits both the NET and SERT, or 10 mg/kg per day phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, produced antidepressant-like effects on behavior without altering NET or SERT expression. Venlafaxine blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT and NET), with higher affinity for SERT. Chronic venlafaxine treatment affected SERT and NET binding differently from paroxetine or desipramine. Venlafaxine blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT and NET), with higher affinity for SERT Paroxetine and venlafaxine are potent serotonin transporter (SERT) antagonists and weaker norepinephrine transporter (NET) antagonists Using a novel blood assay that estimates CNS transporter occupancy we estimated the relative SERT and NET occupancy of paroxetine and venlafaxine in human subjects to assess the relative magnitude of SERT and NET inhibition Treatment for 14 days with 70 mg/kg per day venlafaxine, which inhibits both the NET and SERT, or 10 mg/kg per day phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, produced antidepressant-like effects on behavior without altering NET or SERT expression We then performed the first reported investigation of epistasis between the SERT gene and norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2, alias NET) in AN, as an earlier study suggested that atypical AN responds to the dual serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine Of particular interest were the findings that paroxetine, generally thought of as a selective SERT antagonist, possesses moderately high affinity for the NET and that venlafaxine, which has been described as a &quot;dual uptake inhibitor&quot;, possesses weak affinity for the NET The ratios of measured occupancy ED(50) values (doses at which 50% occupancy occurs) among SERT, NET and DAT sites for duloxetine, venlafaxine, nomifensine, indatraline, DOV 21,947 and DOV 216,303 were consistent with the ratios of the in vitro affinities between these target binding sites SERT and NET occupancy by venlafaxine and milnacipran in nonhuman primates: a PET study In this study in nonhuman primates, we aimed to investigate the relationship between SERT and NET affinity by measuring the in vivo occupancy at both transporters of venlafaxine and milnacipran We hypothesized that venlafaxine would affect monoamine transporters dose-dependently, with low doses causing selective reduction of SERT binding sites and higher doses reducing both SERT and NET binding sites Comparative studies with clinically used antidepressants showed that venlafaxine possessed a profile similar to S33005 but was less potent. Clomipramine likewise interacted with SERTs and NETs but also with several other receptors types, while citalopram and reboxetine were preferential ligands of SERTs and NETs, respectively. In conclusion, S33005 interacts potently with SERTs and, less markedly, with NETs.  Venlafaxine blocks both serotonin and norepinephrine transporters (SERT and NET), with higher affinity for SERT. Serotonergic effects occur with lower doses, whereas both serotonergic and noradrenergic effects occur with higher doses of venlafaxine. Taken together, the results from this study indicate that the low dose of venlafaxine blocked selectively the reuptake of 5-HT, whereas the high dose blocked the reuptake of both 5-HT and NE. Moreover, an enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission by venlafaxine was only achieved under conditions whereby the desensitization of the terminal 5-HT(1B) autoreceptor is appended to that of the somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) receptor.	yes
144	56f555b609dd18d46b000007	Is TALEN being used on stem cells?	Precise correction of the dystrophin gene in duchenne muscular dystrophy patient induced pluripotent stem cells by TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9. Genetic correction of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by TALENs or CRISPR-Cas9 holds promise for DMD gene therapy; however, the safety of such nuclease treatment must be determined. We generated helper-dependent, capsid-modified adenovirus (HD-Ad5/35) vectors for zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)- or transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated genome editing in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from mobilized adult donors.

Low incidence of off-target mutations in individual CRISPR-Cas9 and TALEN targeted human stem cell clones detected by whole-genome sequencing. Using CRISPR-Cas9 and TALEN targeted human pluripotent stem cell clones, we performed whole-genome sequencing at high coverage in order to assess the degree of mutagenesis across the entire genome. A modified TALEN-based system for robust generation of knock-out human pluripotent stem cell lines and disease models. In this study, we utilized a cell-penetrating peptide-based system for ZFN and TALEN delivery. At all loci tested we obtained human embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones carrying transgenic cassettes solely at the TALEN-specified location. We report here the use of TALENs to rapidly and efficiently generate mutant alleles of 15 genes in cultured somatic cells or human pluripotent stem cells, the latter for which we differentiated both the targeted lines and isogenic control lines into various metabolic cell types. Zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) have been successfully used to knock out endogenous genes in stem cell research. Here we report different methods to efficiently perform TALEN-mediated gene integration and inactivation in different mammalian cell systems including induced pluripotent stem cells and delineate experimental examples associated with these approaches Together, our results demonstrate that TALE-based transcriptional repressor and TALENs are two promising approaches for loss-of-function studies of microRNA clusters in somatic cells and pluripotent stem cells We report here the use of TALENs to rapidly and efficiently generate mutant alleles of 15 genes in cultured somatic cells or human pluripotent stem cells, the latter for which we differentiated both the targeted lines and isogenic control lines into various metabolic cell types TALEN-mediated generation and genetic correction of disease-specific human induced pluripotent stem cells. Baculoviral transduction facilitates TALEN-mediated targeted transgene integration and Cre/LoxP cassette exchange in human-induced pluripotent stem cells. We used transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated gene editing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) to produce mice with targeted gene disruptions and insertions in two Y-linked genes--Sry and Uty.  Using CRISPR-Cas9 and TALEN targeted human pluripotent stem cell clones, we performed whole-genome sequencing at high coverage in order to assess the degree of mutagenesis across the entire genome.  A 5% modification rate was observed in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) treated with TAT-TALEN as measured by the Surveyor assay.  TAT-TALEN protein-mediated gene disruption was applicable in hiPSCs and represents a promising technique for gene knockout in stem cells. Here we engineered transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) for five distinct genomic loci. At all loci tested we obtained human embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones carrying transgenic cassettes solely at the TALEN-specified location. Seamless correction of the sickle cell disease mutation of the HBB gene in human induced pluripotent stem cells using TALENs. At all loci tested we obtained human embryonic stem cell (ESC) and induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones carrying transgenic cassettes solely at the TALEN-specified location. Our data suggest that TALENs employing the specific architectures described here mediate site-specific genome modification in human pluripotent cells with similar efficiency and precision as do zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs).	yes
146	53443b13aeec6fbd0700000e	Can a peptide aptamer be used as protein inhibitor?	Peptide aptamers of LIM-only protein 2 (Lmo2) were previously used to successfully treat Lmo2-induced tumours in a mouse model of leukaemia. Inhibition of mammalian cell proliferation by genetically selected peptide aptamers that functionally antagonize E2F activity. Accumulating work over the past decade has shown that peptide aptamer screening represents a valid strategy for inhibitor identification that can be applied to a variety of different targets.  . The target of one inhibitor peptide, Pep80, identified in this screen was determined to be Snapin, a protein associated with the soluble N-ethyl maleimide sensitive factor adaptor protein receptor (SNARE) complex that is critical for calcium-dependent exocytosis during neurotransmission.  Use of the genetically selected intracellular aptamer inhibitors allowed us to define unique mechanisms important to HIV-1 replication and T cell biology. This review will describe pre-clinical and clinical data of four major classes of TGF-β inhibitor, namely i) ligand traps, ii) antisense oligonucleotides, iii) receptor kinase inhibitors and iv) peptide aptamers.   A peptide aptamer (ID1/3-PA7) has been designed to prevent this interaction and thereby leading to the transcription of p16(INK4a). A peptide kinase inhibitor (IP(20)) was used as the aptameric peptide  Peptide aptamer mimicking RAD51-binding domain of BRCA2 inhibits DNA damage repair and survival in Trypanosoma brucei.  peptide aptamer, Id1/3-PA7, targeting Id1 and Id3, Targeting Id1 and Id3 by a specific peptide aptamer induces E-box promoter activity, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Aptamer-derived peptides as potent inhibitors of the oncogenic RhoGEF Tgat. Our approach thus demonstrates that peptide aptamers are potent inhibitors that can be used to interfere with RhoGEF functions in vivo. Development of systemic in vitro evolution and its application to generation of peptide-aptamer-based inhibitors of cathepsin E. he fusion peptide, TA aptamer, was observed within PC12 cytoplasm and maintained both Abeta-binding ability and antioxygenic property similar to TRX. Stable expression of a novel fusion peptide of thioredoxin-1 and ABAD-inhibiting peptide protects PC12 cells from intracellular amyloid-beta. In order to efficiently select aptamers that bind to and inhibit proteins, Aptamer selection based on inhibitory activity using an evolution-mimicking algorithm. This demonstrates the utility of this strategy for screening aptamers based on their inhibitory actions. Intracellular expression of the DRD-binding peptide aptamer specifically suppressed receptor-mediated extrinsic apoptosis but not intrinsic pathway, which was recapitulated by the antisense oligonucleotides for FLASH.  Peptide aptamers are peptides constrained and presented by a scaffold protein that are used to study protein function in cells. They are able to disrupt protein-protein interactions  Here we have used a genetic screen in yeast to select in vivo peptides coupled to thioredoxin, called aptamers, that could inhibit GEFD2 activity. One aptamer, TRIAPalpha (TRio Inhibitory APtamer), specifically blocks GEFD2-exchange activity on RhoA in vitro. These results show that cell proliferation can be inhibited using genetically-selected synthetic peptides that specifically target protein-protein interaction motifs within cell cycle regulators. These data highlight the utility of peptide aptamers to identify novel binding interfaces and highlight a role for MAP1B in DAPK-1-dependent signaling in autophagy and membrane blebbing.	yes
157	56ae67a40a360a5e4500000c	Is there any link between the aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein ring1B?	The aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein ring1B combine to regulate active promoters in quiescent lymphocytes. We show that the Aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein Ring1B have essential roles in regulating transcriptionally active genes in quiescent lymphocytes. Ring1B and Aurora B bind to a wide range of active promoters in resting B and T cells. Conditional knockout of either protein results in reduced transcription and binding of RNA Pol II to promoter regions and decreased cell viability. Aurora B phosphorylates histone H3S28 at active promoters in resting B cells as well as inhibiting Ring1B-mediated ubiquitination of histone H2A and enhancing binding and activity of the USP16 deubiquitinase at transcribed genes. Our results identify a mechanism for regulating transcription in quiescent cells that has implications for epigenetic regulation of the choice between proliferation and quiescence. We show that the Aurora B kinase and the polycomb protein Ring1B have essential roles in regulating transcriptionally active genes in quiescent lymphocytes.

Several immunodeficiencies have been treated successfully by stem cell-targeted, retroviral-mediated gene transfer with reconstitution of the immune system following infusion of the transduced cells. In this work we have developed and tested a self-inactivating (SIN) gammaretroviral vector (SINfes.gp91s) containing a codon-optimized transgene (gp91(phox)) under the transcriptional control of a myeloid promoter for the gene therapy of the X-linked form of CGD (X-CGD).  We used a lentiviral vector encoding functional WASP to genetically correct HSPCs from three WAS patients and reinfused the cells after a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen We used a lentiviral vector to transfer a functional ARSA gene into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from three presymptomatic patients who showed genetic, biochemical, and neurophysiological evidence of late infantile MLD.  We assessed lentiviral vectors (LVs) targeted to the EC surface marker CD105 for in vivo gene delivery. gef and apoptin genes were cloned into a doxycycline-regulated retrovirus-mediated gene expression system.	yes
189	5727b6410fd6f91b6800001b	Is autism one of the characteristics of Moebius syndrome?	The diagnosis of Moebius syndrome, a rare congenital disorder, is primarily based on congenital facial and abducent nerve palsy. Involvement of other cranial nerves is also common. Occasionally the V, X, XI, and XII cranial nerves are involved, resulting in a difficulty to chew, swallow, and cough, which often leads to respiratory complications. Mental retardation and autism have been reported in some cases Moebius sequence is a rare congenital disorder usually defined as a combination of facial weakness with impairment of ocular abduction. A strong association of Moebius sequence with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has been suggested in earlier studies with heterogenous age groups Certain genetic syndromes are providing us with extremely valuable information about the role played by genetics in autism. This is the case of the following syndromes: Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, 15q11-q13 duplication, fragile X syndrome, fragile X premutation, deletion of chromosome 2q, XYY syndrome, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Apert syndrome, mutations in the ARX gene, De Lange syndrome, Smith-Magenis syndrome, Williams syndrome, Rett syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Down syndrome, velo-cardio-facial syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Steinert disease, tuberous sclerosis, Duchenne's disease, Timothy syndrome, 10p terminal deletion, Cowden syndrome, 45,X/46,XY mosaicism, Myhre syndrome, Sotos syndrome, Cohen syndrome, Goldenhar syndrome, Joubert syndrome, Lujan-Fryns syndrome, Moebius syndrome, hypomelanosis of Ito, neurofibromatosis type 1, CHARGE syndrome and HEADD syndrome. Seventeen children and young adults with Moebius syndrome were examined with a view to finding symptoms of autism. Some 40% of the group showed all or many of the symptoms typical of autistic disorder Fifty-nine cases with infantile autism/autistic disorder were subclassified according to associated medical condition (fragile-X, tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis, hypo-melanosis of Ito, Moebius syndrome, Rett syndrome, and a 'new' syndrome associated with a marker chromosome).

196	55422640ccca0ce74b000004	Does GC content vary markedly within a given isochore?	"The isochore, a large DNA sequence with relatively small GC variance, is one of the most important structures in eukaryotic genomes. Isochores are large regions of relatively homogeneous nucleotide composition Vertebrate genomes are comprised of isochores that are relatively long (>100 kb) regions with a relatively homogenous (either GC-rich or AT-rich) base composition and with rather sharp boundaries with neighboring isochores. The human genome is composed of large sequence segments with fairly homogeneous GC content, namely isochores Isochores, i.e. stretches of DNA with a distinct sequence composition and thus a specific GC content The human genome is composed of long stretches of DNA with distinct GC contents, called isochores or GC-content domains. The human genome is divided into isochores, large stretches (>>300 kb) of genomic DNA with more or less consistent GC content.  Many eukaryotic genomes contain isochore regions, mosaics of homogeneous GC content that can abruptly change from one neighboring isochore to the next. One of the most striking features of mammalian and birds chromosomes is the variation in the guanine-cytosine (GC) content that occurs over scales of hundreds of kilobases to megabases; this is known as the ""isochore"" structure. The segmentation analysis shows that there are stronger indications of GC content changes at isochore borders than within an isochore. This partitioning is a natural one, since large-scale compositional properties vary much more among isochores than within them. This partitioning is a natural one, since large-scale compositional properties vary much more among isochores than within them. An isochore sequence may pass a homogeneity test when GC content fluctuations at smaller length scales are ignored or averaged out. This partitioning is a natural one, since large-scale compositional properties vary much more among isochores than within them"	no

Gfi-1B controls human erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation by regulating TGF-beta signaling at the bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitor stage Growth factor independence-1B (Gfi-1B) is a transcriptional repressor essential for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive erythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis We here show that, in humans, Gfi-1B controls the development of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors To date, we have identified two common integration sites involving genes encoding transcription factors that play a critical role in hematopoiesis (Evi1 and Gfi1b loci) Transcription factors play essential roles in both normal and malignant hematopoiesis. This is the case for the growth factor independent 1b (GFI1B) transcription factor, which is required for erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation and over-expressed in leukemic patients and cell lines We localized several conserved non-coding elements containing multiple erythroid specific transcription factor binding sites at the GFI1B locus. In GFI1B-expressing cells a subset of these conserved non-coding elements and the promoter adopt a close spatial conformation, localize with open chromatin sites, harbor chromatin modifications associated with gene activation and bind multiple transcription factors and co-repressors Our findings indicate that GFI1B regulatory elements behave as activators and repressors To investigate the molecular effects of growth factor independence 1B (Gfi-1B), a transcription factor essential for the development of hematopoietic cells and differentiation of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages Our data indicate that Gfi-1B signalling is important for commitment and maturation of hematopoietic cell populations Gfi-1 and Gfi-1b are homologous transcriptional repressors involved in diverse developmental contexts, including hematopoiesis and oncogenesis Gfi1b:green fluorescent protein knock-in mice reveal a dynamic expression pattern of Gfi1b during hematopoiesis that is largely complementary to Gfi1 We found highly dynamic expression patterns of Gfi1b in erythroid cells, megakaryocytes, and their progenitor cells (MEPS) where Gfi1 is not detected. Vice versa, Gfi1b could not be found in granulocytes, activated macrophages, or their granulomonocytic precursors (GMPs) or in mature naive or activated lymphocytes where Gfi1 is expressed, suggesting a complementary regulation of both loci during hematopoiesis Gfi1 and Gfi1b act equivalently in haematopoiesis our findings show that an intact SNAG domain is essential for all functions of Gfi1 and that Gfi1b can replace Gfi1 functionally in haematopoiesis Gfi-1 oncoproteins in hematopoiesis Recent gene targeting experiments and mutational screening in humans have revealed an essential role for Gfi-1 and Gfi-1B in hematopoiesis Gfi-1B disruption is embryonic lethal due to a block of erythropoiesis. Gfi-1B is required for both erythroid and megakaryocyte development Erythroid expansion mediated by the Gfi-1B zinc finger protein: role in normal hematopoiesis  we identified that the expression of Gfi-1B (growth factor independence-1B) is highly restricted to hematopoietic stem cells, erythroblasts, and megakaryocytes These findings establish Gfi-1B as a novel erythroid regulator and reveal its specific involvement in the regulation of erythroid cell growth through modulating erythroid-specific gene expression The zinc-finger proto-oncogene Gfi-1b is essential for development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages we establish that Gfi-1b is required for the development of two related blood lineages, erythroid and megakaryocytic, in mice Gfi-1b(-/-) embryonic stem cells fail to contribute to red cells of adult chimeras. Gfi-1b(-/-) embryos exhibit delayed maturation of primitive erythrocytes and subsequently die with failure to produce definitive enucleated erythrocytes Gfi-1b is an essential transcriptional regulator of erythroid and megakaryocyte development Growth factor independence 1b (GFI1B) is a DNA binding repressor of transcription with vital functions in hematopoiesis. Conversely, loss of gfi1b silences runx-1, c-myb, ikaros and cd41, indicating that gfi1b is required for definitive hematopoiesis. Gfi1b:green fluorescent protein knock-in mice reveal a dynamic expression pattern of Gfi1b during hematopoiesis that is largely complementary to Gfi1. Gfi1 and Gfi1b: key regulators of hematopoiesis. We show that gfi1aa and gfi1b are expressed in the primitive and definitive sites of hematopoiesis in zebrafish. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive erythrocytes, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis. Growth factor independence 1b (gfi1b) is important for the maturation of erythroid cells and the regulation of embryonic globin expression. Growth factor-independence 1b (Gfi1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for erythroid and megakaryocytic development. Gfi1b (growth factor independence 1b) is a zinc finger transcription factor essential for development of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. In fact, we demonstrate that VPA treatment is able to induce the expression of growth factor-independent protein 1B (GFI1B) and of mixed-lineage leukemia translocated to chromosome 3 protein (MLLT3), which are crucial regulators of erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation, and that the up-regulation of these genes is mediated by the histone hyperacetylation at their promoter sites.

Accumulating evidence links vitamin D deficiency with abnormal glucose metabolism, and epidemiological studies have shown that women who develop GDM are more likely to be vitamin D deficient This review discusses the prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes of GDM and vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women, outlines the possible mechanism of action of vitamin D in glucose homeostasis, and summarizes emerging evidence that associates vitamin D deficiency with the risk of developing GDM Women with circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level less than 50 nmol/l in pregnancy experienced an increased risk of preeclampsia [OR 2.09 (95%CI 1.50 -2.90)], gestational diabetes mellitus [OR1.38 (1.12-1.70)] Low maternal vitamin D levels in pregnancy may be associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, Association between vitamin D insufficiency and the risk for gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnant Chinese women 25OHD insufficiency is very common in Chinese women. Low 25OHD status may be associated with insulin resistance and act as a risk factor for GDM. Second-trimester 25(OH)D levels were associated inversely with glucose levels after 1-hour 50-g glucose challenge test; low 25(OH)D levels may be associated with increased risk of GDM. Two hundred sixty-six women were screened. Vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D <20 ng/mL) was observed in 157 women (59%). We observed an inverse correlation between 25(OH)D levels and hemoglobin A1c, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, serum insulin, and fasting and 1-hour oral glucose tolerance test glucose levels Lower 25(OH)D levels are associated with disorders of glucose homeostasis and adverse obstetric and newborn outcomes. An association between mid-gestational 25-hydroxy vitamin D and fasting glucose was confirmed in a largely normoglycaemic and vitamin D-replete pregnant population. The correlation between 25-hydroxy vitamin D and β-cell function suggests that vitamin D may influence glucose metabolism through this mechanism. Women with gestational diabetes had significantly lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D compared with control subjects (56.3 vs. 62.0 nmol/l, P = 0.018). After adjusting for gestational age and maternal weight, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D below the top quartile (< 73.5 nmol/l) was associated with a twofold greater likelihood of gestational diabetes (adjusted odds ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.19-4.13). CONCLUSIONS: Lower vitamin D status in early pregnancy was associated with a significantly increased risk of subsequent gestational diabetes that was independent of race, age, season and maternal weight. This study suggests that vitamin D may influence glucose tolerance during pregnancy Vitamin D deficiency among pregnant women is frequent in many populations over the world. It is associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, and caesarean section Consequences in newborns are low birth weight, neonatal rickets, a risk of neonatal hypocalcemia, asthma and/or type 1 diabetes. A single injection of 300,000 IU of vitamin D3 achieves a 3-month serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D range of 50-80 nmol/l and is an efficient, effective and safe procedure for improving the vitamin status and indices of insulin resistance in mothers with gestational diabetes after delivery. In a cohort of pregnant women with mostly sufficient levels of serum 25(OH)D, vitamin D deficiency was not associated with GDM. The aim of the study is evaluating the associations of FokI vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and its relations with postpartum metabolic syndrome. Our results indicate a meaningful association between FokI VDR genotypes and an increase risk of GDM in Iranian population as well as its effects on postpartum metabolic syndrome. The first-trimester maternal serum level of 25(OH)D is not altered in women with type 2 diabetes, those who develop GDM or those who deliver LGA neonates. Lower 25(OH)D levels are independently associated with poorer glycaemic control. Future randomised trials are needed to determine whether vitamin D plays a role in glycaemic control in GDM. These results suggested that rates of vitamin D deficiency are higher among women with IGT/GDM, and the relationship between vitamin D status and glucose tolerance in pregnancy needs further study. It appears that vitamin D insufficiency during pregnancy is potentially associated with increased risk of preeclampsia, insulin resistance and gestational diabetes mellitus Mean serum 25OHD concentration was 53.8 +/- 23.9 nmol/l (sd). Ln-25OHD was negatively correlated with serum parathyroid hormone as expected (r -0.24, confidence intervals -0.35 to -0.12). Ln-25OHD was also negatively correlated with fasting plasma glucose (r-0.20, -0.31 to -0.08), fasting insulin (r -0.20, -0.31 to -0.08) and insulin resistance as calculated by homeostasis model assessment (r -0.21, -0.32 to -0.09). The association between fasting glucose and log-transformed 25OHD concentration was of borderline significance after accounting for ethnicity, age and body mass index in multivariate analyses (-0.13, -0.26 to 0.01). The odds ratio of gestational diabetes in women with 25OHD < 50 nmol/l did not reach statistical significance (1.92, 95% confidence interval 0.89-4.17). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal 25OHD concentrations are inversely related to fasting glucose, although further studies are required to establish whether this is independent of the effects of ethnic background. Vitamin D insufficiency is common in Indian mothers but is not associated with gestational diabetes or variation in newborn size. There was no association between maternal 25(OH)D and gestational diabetes (incidence 7% in women with and without hypovitaminosis D) In mothers with hypovitaminosis D, higher 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with lower 30-min glucose concentrations (P=0.03) and higher fasting proinsulin concentrations (P=0.04) Hypovitaminosis D at 30 weeks gestation is common in Mysore mothers. It is not associated with an increased risk of gestational diabetes, Total prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (<25 nmol/L) was found in 70.6% of pregnant women. Prevalence of severe vitamin D deficiency (<12.5) in GDM patients was higher than in normoglycaemic pregnancies. These results show that a positive correlation of 25(OH) vitamin D concentrations with insulin sensitivity and vitamin D deficiency could be a confirmative sign of insulin resistance. was to examine whether maternal dietary intake of vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and omega-6 fatty acids during pregnancy is associated with the appearance of islet autoimmunity (IA) in offspring Maternal intake of vitamin D via food was significantly associated with a decreased risk of IA appearance in offspring, independent of HLA genotype, family history of type 1 diabetes, presence of gestational diabetes mellitus, and ethnicity (adjusted HR = 0.37; 95% CI 0.17-0.78). Vitamin D intake via supplements, omega-3 fatty acids, and omega-6 fatty acids intake during pregnancy were not associated with appearance of IA in offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that maternal intake of vitamin D through food during pregnancy may have a protective effect on the appearance of IA in offspring.	yes
291	56b481348525abca1e000008	Are there currently applications of deep learning in genomics?	Deep learning of the tissue-regulated splicing code. Using a deep neural network, we developed a model inferred from mouse RNA-Seq data that can predict splicing patterns in individual tissues and differences in splicing patterns across tissues. Our architecture uses hidden variables that jointly represent features in genomic sequences and tissue types when making predictions. A graphics processing unit was used to greatly reduce the training time of our models with millions of parameters. We show that the deep architecture surpasses the performance of the previous Bayesian method for predicting AS patterns. With the proper optimization procedure and selection of hyperparameters, we demonstrate that deep architectures can be beneficial, even with a moderately sparse dataset. An analysis of what the model has learned in terms of the genomic features is presented. Machine learning applications in genetics and genomics	yes

314	51490275d24251bc0500003d	Is nimodipine recommended for prevention of vasospasm in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?	This article discusses some of these unresolved issues, including the use of medications such as nimodipine, antifibrinolytics, statins, and magnesium; coiling or clipping for aneurysm securement; and the prevention and treatment of potential complications. The results of this study were as follows: nimodipine demonstrated benefit following aneurysmal SAH; other calcium channel blockers, including nicardipine, do not provide unequivocal benefit; triple-H therapy, fasudil, transluminal balloon angioplasty, thrombolytics, endothelin receptor antagonists, magnesium, statins, and miscellaneous therapies such as free radical scavengers and antifibrinolytics require additional study. The present results suggest that fasudil is equally or more effective than nimodipine for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm and subsequent ischemic injury in patients undergoing surgery for SAH. Three studies (2 meta-analyses and 1 randomized controlled trial) demonstrated that nimodipine use confers benefits (reduced morbidity and mortality) for patients with aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Nimodipine is the only preventative treatment that can be recommended. Nimodipine (Nimotop), HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor (statins) and enoxaparin (Lovenox) were the only drugs with level-1 evidence available for the treatment of vasospasm from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage as defined by the US Preventative Services Task Force. The calcium antagonist nimodipine has been shown to reduce the incidence of ischemic complications following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). There was no significant difference in the incidence of DINDs (28 vs 30% in the peroral and intravenous groups, respectively) or middle cerebral artery blood flow velocities (> 120 cm/second, 50 vs 45%, respectively). Clinical outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale was the same in both groups, and there was no difference in the number of patients with new infarctions on MR imaging. The results suggest that there is no clinically relevant difference in efficacy between peroral and intravenous administration of nimodipine in preventing DINDs or cerebral vasospasm following SAH. the risk of delayed cerebral ischemia is reduced with nimodipine and avoiding hypovolemia A recommendations (standard) for the prophylaxis and treatment of cerebral vasospasm with oral Nimodipine in good grade patients. Of the 75 patients initially considered for active treatment, 83% underwent surgery within 48 hours of rupture, all received nimodipine, 16% received tissue plasminogen activator to lyse subarachnoid or intraventricular clots, 40% underwent hypertensive treatment, and 7% underwent transluminal balloon angioplasty for vasospasm. All patients with aneurysmal SAH should be treated with the calcium antagonist nimodipine, and in certain circumstances patients should receive anticonvulsants. The following review gives an account of pathophysiological mechanisms; the importance of treatment with calcium antagonists, hypervolaemic haemodilution, and induced arterial hypertension is discussed in light of the current literature. Seven placebo-controlled clinical studies have shown that nimodipine improves the outcome of patients with severe neurological damage due to cerebral vasospasm. In a series of 100 individuals with a ruptured supratentorial aneurysm, who were subjected to aneurysm operation in the acute stage and who subsequently received intravenous treatment with the calcium channel blocker nimodipine, the occurrence of DID with FND was reduced to 5%. There are many possible successful treatment options for preventing vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurologic deficits, and poor neurologic outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, further multicenter RCTs need to be performed to determine if there is a significant benefit from their use. Nimodipine is the only treatment that provided a significant benefit across multiple studies. Absence of symptomatic vasospasm, occurrence of low density areas associated with vasospasm on CT, and occurrence of adverse events were similar between the two groups. The clinical outcomes were more favorable in the fasudil group than in the nimodipine group (p = 0.040). The proportion of patients with good clinical outcome was 74.5% (41/55) in the fasudil group and 61.7% (37/60) in the nimodipine group. Cerebral vasospasm is the classic cause of delayed neurological deterioration leading to cerebral ischemia and infarction, and thus, poor outcome and occasionally death, after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Advances in diagnosis and treatment, principally nimodipine, intensive care management, hemodynamic manipulations, and endovascular neuroradiology procedures, have improved the prospects for these patients, but outcomes remain disappointing. Cerebral vasospasm is the classic cause of delayed neurological deterioration after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, leading to cerebral ischemia and infarction, and thus to poor outcome and occasionally death. Advances in diagnosis and treatment-principally the use of nimodipine, intensive care management, hemodynamic manipulations and endovascular neuroradiology procedures-have improved the prospects for these patients, but outcomes remain disappointing. Cerebral vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia remain common complications of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and yet therapies for cerebral vasospasm are limited. Despite a large number of clinical trials, only calcium antagonists have strong evidence supporting their effectiveness. The only proven therapy for vasospasm is nimodipine. nimodipine is indicated after SAH and tirilazad is not effective. Fasudil hydrochloride and nimodipine both showed inhibitory effects on cerebral vasospasm. The incidence of symptomatic vasospasm was five of 33 patients in the fasudil group and nine of 32 patients in the nimodipine group. Good recovery evaluated by the Glasgow Outcome Scale was achieved by 23 of 33 patients in the fasudil group and 19 of 34 patients in the nimodipine group. Both drugs significantly improved consciousness levels and neurological deficits such as aphasia. However, fasudil hydrochloride improved motor disturbance more than nimodipine.	yes
316	56c0968def6e394741000026	Was tamoxifen tested for treatment of glioma patients?	Tamoxifen might have a role in the initial treatment of high-grade gliomas and should be studied in future Phase II trials building on the newly established platform of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The addition of high-dose tamoxifen to standard radiotherapy does not improve the survival of patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma. In this study, in which tamoxifen was used in conjunction with radiotherapy, progression free survival was shown to be less good when compared with historical data HR = 3.1 (CI: 1.7-5.7). The addition of high-dose tamoxifen, although well tolerated, confers no clinical benefit to patients treated with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma treated with standard radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Carboplatin and high dose tamoxifen has similar response rates to other regimens for recurrent malignant gliomas and are probably equivalent to those found using tamoxifen as monotherapy.  CONCLUSIONS: Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin administered alone or in combination with tamoxifen is safe and moderately effective in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors such as high-dose tamoxifen and hypericin also have been used in the treatment of malignant gliomas.  Considering these facts, polyethylene-glycol-liposomal doxorubicin with and without tamoxifen was evaluated within two sequential Phase II trials performed at our institution.  In a parallel phase-II-study investigating post-operative treatment with tamoxifen (TAM), carboplatin and radiation therapy for glioblastomas, 16 of 49 patients (33%) showed multifocal recurrence, which developed after a mean of 46 weeks, raising the question of an association with therapy. Radiation therapy and high-dose tamoxifen in the treatment of patients with diffuse brainstem gliomas: results of a Brazilian cooperative study. Brainstem Glioma Cooperative Group. PURPOSE: The efficacy of radiation therapy (RT) combined with tamoxifen (TX) was tested in patients diagnosed with diffuse brainstem gliomas in a multicenter trial. CONCLUSION: This treatment combination produced no significant change in the overall poor prognosis of these patients. Most tumors responded initially to treatment but recurred as the study progressed. A minority of patients seemed to benefit from the extended use of TX.  Tamoxifen, a protein kinase C inhibitor when administered in high dosages, is currently being used as an adjuvant in the treatment of patients with malignant gliomas. We present a patient with a recurrent malignant glioma who was continued on high dose tamoxifen despite radiologic documented doubling of the tumor size and who eventually showed a delayed response to this agent nine months after initiation of treatment. The combination of oral tamoxifen (120 to 240 mg/m2/day) and subcutaneous interferon-alpha [6 x 10(6) U three times per week] was associated with significant neurotoxicity in this group of recurrent glioma patients, resulting in early study closure.

We tested the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of high-dose tamoxifen and interferon alpha in adults with recurrent glioma in a phase II trial. Eligible patients had radiographically measurable recurrent gliomas of any grade after initial radiation therapy. Thyroid function was suppressed to reduce IGF-1 levels in glioma patients and high-dose tamoxifen administered.  Propylthiouracil was used to induce chemical hypothyroidism in 22 patients with recurrent glioma. Activity against recurrent gliomas has been reported for both tamoxifen and interferon alpha, agents that have more acceptable toxicity profiles and that can be administered in an outpatient setting. We tested the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of high-dose tamoxifen and interferon alpha in adults with recurrent glioma in a phase II trial.

We tested the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of high-dose tamoxifen and interferon alpha in adults with recurrent glioma in a phase II trial. The subsequent in vitro testing of the tumor that was removed after the recurrence of tumor (22 months after the initiation of tamoxifen) revealed loss of sensitivity to tamoxifen. The combination of oral tamoxifen (120 to 240 mg/m2/day) and subcutaneous interferon-alpha [6 x 10(6) U three times per week] was associated with significant neurotoxicity in this group of recurrent glioma patients, resulting in early study closure.	yes
333	5149b575d24251bc05000047	Is there a difference in the rate between gene fusion and gene fission?	"we illustrate arrangement diversity within closely related organisms, estimate arrangement turnover frequency and establish, for the first time, branch-specific rate estimates for fusion, fission, domain addition and terminal loss. Rate and polarity of gene fusion and fission in Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana We have identified all differentially composite or split genes in 2 fully sequenced plant genomes, Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana Polarizing these events by outgroup comparison revealed differences in the rate of gene fission but not of gene fusion in the rice and Arabidopsis lineages. Gene fission occurred at a higher rate than gene fusion in the O. sativa lineage and was furthermore more common in rice than in Arabidopsis. Gene fusion and fission are thus rare and slow processes in higher plant genomes; they should be of utility to address deeper evolutionary relationships among plants--and the relationship of plants to other eukaryotic lineages--where sequence-based phylogenies provide equivocal or conflicting results. Primary factors correlating with fusion rates are the presence of transmembrane helices in HKs and the presence of DNA-binding domains in RRs, features that require correct (and separate) spatial location. In the absence of such features, there is a relative abundance of fused genes. We show that indels are the most frequent elementary events and that they occur in most cases at either the N- or C-terminus of the proteins. As revealed by the genomic neighbourhood/context of the corresponding genes, we show that a substantial number of these terminal indels are the consequence of gene fusions/fissions. We provide evidence showing that the contribution of gene fusion/fission to the evolution of multi-domain bacterial proteins is lower-bounded by 27% and upper-bounded by 64%. We conclude that gene fusion/fission is a major contributor to the evolution of multi-domain bacterial proteins. We found that fusion events are approximately four times more common than fission events, and we established that, in most cases, any particular fusion or fission event only occurred once during the course of evolution. Analyzing the most parsimonious pathways, we find 87% of architectures to gain complexity over time through simple changes, among which fusion events account for 5.6 times as many architectures as fission. These trees defined timelines of architectural discovery and revealed remarkable evolutionary patterns, including the explosive appearance of domain combinations during the rise of organismal lineages, the dominance of domain fusion processes throughout evolution, and the late appearance of a new class of multifunctional modules in Eukarya by fission of domain combinations We searched for examples which have arisen by one of the three postulated mechanisms: independent fusion/fission, ""duplication/deletion,"" and plasmid-mediated ""cut and paste."" We conclude that all three mechanisms can be observed, with the independent fusion/fission being the most frequent."	yes
339	56ae69fb0a360a5e4500000d	Are DNA methylation maps applicable to the diagnosis of non-small-cell lung carcinomas?	Here we present a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of NSCLC samples and paired lung tissues, where we combine MethylCap and next generation sequencing (MethylCap-seq) to provide comprehensive DNA methylation maps of the tumor and paired lung samples. Analysis of the MethylCap-seq data revealed a strong positive correlation between replicate experiments and between paired tumor/lung samples. We identified 57 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) present in all NSCLC tumors analyzed by MethylCap-seq. While hypomethylated DMRs did not correlate to any particular functional category of genes, the hypermethylated DMRs were strongly associated with genes encoding transcriptional regulators. Furthermore, subtelomeric regions and satellite repeats were hypomethylated in the NSCLC samples. We also identified DMRs that were specific to two of the major subtypes of NSCLC, adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Collectively, we provide a resource containing genome-wide DNA methylation maps of NSCLC and their paired lung tissues, and comprehensive lists of known and novel DMRs and associated genes in NSCLC. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of non-small cell lung carcinomas. Genomewide DNA methylation analysis identifies novel methylated genes in non-small-cell lung carcinomas. To identify candidate markers for use in NSCLC diagnosis, we used genomewide DNA methylation maps that we had previously generated by MethylCap and next-generation sequencing and listed the most significant differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The 25 DMRs with highest significance in their methylation scores were selected. The methylation status of these DMRs was investigated in 61 tumors and matching control lung tissues by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. We found 12 novel DMRs that showed significant differences between tumor and control lung tissues. We also identified three novel DMRs for each of the two most common NSCLC subtypes, adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. We propose a panel of five DMRs, composed of novel and known markers that exhibit high specificity and sensitivity to distinguish tumors from control lung tissues. Here we present a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of NSCLC samples and paired lung tissues, where we combine MethylCap and next generation sequencing (MethylCap-seq) to provide comprehensive DNA methylation maps of the tumor and paired lung samples. It is a very stable and specific modification and therefore in principle a very suitable marker for epigenetic phenotyping of tumors.

353	53319653d6d3ac6a3400003e	Does prudent diet reduce cardiovascular risk?	"Using this approach, large prospective studies have reported reductions in CVD risk ranging from 10 to 60% in groups whose diets can be variously classified as ‘Healthy’, ‘Prudent’, Mediterranean’ or ‘DASH compliant’. Our findings suggest that a heart healthy dietary pattern is associated with moderately reduced risk of MI, but not related to risk of VTE. The systematically reviewed studies reveal that a high adherence to a Mediterranean type of diet or ""prudent diet"" is associated with reduced risk of CVD and some types of cancer, even in the elderly. In a large healthy Italian population, non-predefined dietary patterns including foods considered to be rather unhealthy, were associated with higher levels of cardiovascular risk factors, CRP and individual global CVD risk, whereas a ""prudent-healthy"" pattern was associated with lower levels. We observed an inverse association between the prudent pattern and AMI, with higher levels being protective. After multivariable adjustment, the prudent diet was associated with a 28% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality (95% confidence interval [CI], 13 to 40) and a 17% lower risk of all-cause mortality (95% CI, 10 to 24) when the highest quintile was compared with the lowest quintile.  Greater adherence to the prudent pattern may reduce the risk of cardiovascular and total mortality, whereas greater adherence to the Western pattern may increase the risk among initially healthy women. Composite diets (such as DASH diets, Mediterranean diet, 'prudent' diet) have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of hypertension and CHD."	yes

364	56cf2a153975bb303a000004	Does MVIIA and MVIIC bind to the same calcium channel?	We examined the post-pubertal behavioral effects of neonatal (postnatal day 7) medial prefrontal cortex infusion of either vehicle or N-type and P/Q-type presynaptic voltage-dependent calcium channel blockers (omega-conotoxins MVIIA and MVIIC respectively; 6.8 and 45 pmol infused respectively) in rat pups. Additionally, the number of binding sites for radioligands labelling L- ([3H]nitrendipine), N- ([125I]omega-conotoxin MVIIA) and P/Q-type ([125I]omega-conotoxin MVIIC) Ca2+ channels was assessed in the rat retina and, for further comparison, in the rat cortex. Omega-conotoxin MVIIC (MVIIC) blocks P/Q-type calcium channels with high affinity and N-type calcium channels with low affinity, while the highly homologous omega-conotoxin MVIIA blocks only N-type calcium channels. However, omega-conotoxin MVIIC seems to bind to sites different from those recognised by omega-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA, which are markedly differentiated by their Ca2+ requirements for binding to their receptors. Despite their high sequence homology, the peptide neurotoxins omega-conotoxin MVIIA and MVIIC selectively block N- and P/Q-type calcium channels, respectively. Replacement of the N-terminal half of omega-conotoxin MVIIC, a peptide blocker of P/Q-type calcium channels, with that of omega-conotoxin MVIIA significantly increased the affinity for N-type calcium channels.  Omega-conotoxin MVIIC (MVIIC) blocks P/Q-type calcium channels with high affinity and N-type calcium channels with low affinity, while the highly homologous omega-conotoxin MVIIA blocks only N-type calcium channels. We wished to obtain MVIIC analogues more selective for P/Q-type calcium channels than MVIIC to elucidate structural differences among the channels, which discriminate the omega-conotoxins. omega-conotoxin MVIIC seems to bind to sites different from those recognised by omega-conotoxin GVIA and MVIIA,	no
387	513cdc38bee46bd34c000007	Is thrombophilia related to increased risk of miscarriage?	"Thrombophilia does hardly increase the risk of IUGR/PMPC or if so, it can be prevented by LMWH for illustrative purposes, a patient presenting with combined thrombophilia--both genetic and acquired--will be discussed. This patient had suffered severe gestational complications that led to devastating obstetrical outcome Thrombophilias have been implicated in complications related to ischemic placental disease including recurrent pregnancy loss, intrauterine fetal demise, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, and preterm delivery Further information about the combined risk of aPC resistance and pregnancy is needed before guidance on the management of affected women can be formulated. Thrombotic risk during pregnancy and the puerperium is higher in asymptomatic women with than without thrombophilia Further studies are required to assess the thrombotic risk in women with preeclampsia as well as early or late recurrent pregnancy loss. Risk of pregnancy-related venous thrombosis in carriers of severe inherited thrombophilia In conclusion, homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden and, to a lesser extent, double heterozygous carriers of factor V Leiden and of the prothrombin mutation have an increased risk of venous thrombosis during pregnancy, particularly high during the postpartum period Careful diagnosis, observation and monitoring can add significant benefit to LMWH therapy during pregnancy Pregnancy in healthy women is accompanied by hypercoagulable changes that may interact with thrombophilia risk factors and threaten pregnancy. Fifty-three (13 %) women had antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anti-beta2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies) mainly associated with the risk of spontaneous abortion during the first trimester thrombophilia was found to be considerably more common in women with pregnancy-associated complications in comparison with the general population, and most frequently in conjunction with venous thromboembolism during pregnancy and the postpartum period When counseling white women with a history of preeclampsia, screening for thrombophilia can be useful for preconceptional counseling and pregnancy management. knowledge combined with the appropriate use of thromboprophylaxis and treatment in women who have objectively confirmed VTE continue to improve maternal and perinatal outcomes The risk of having thrombophilia is doubled in men who have fathered pregnancies which ended in perinatal death as well as in the mothers of such pregnancies. The prevalence of thrombophilic variants is of possible public health significance for other morbidity; but perhaps not in relation to preeclampsia This study suggests that thrombophilia ""mediates"" in lowering of cardiovascular risk factors in women with a history of preeclampsia"	yes
392	56c1f00aef6e39474100003d	Is selumetinib effective in thyroid cancer?	A phase I trial of vertical inhibition of IGF signalling using cixutumumab, an anti-IGF-1R antibody, and selumetinib, an MEK 1/2 inhibitor, in advanced solid tumours. BACKGROUND: We completed a phase I clinical trial to test the safety and toxicity of combined treatment with cixutumumab (anti-IGF-1R antibody) and selumetinib (MEK 1/2 inhibitor). Two patients achieved a partial response (one unconfirmed), including a patient with BRAF wild-type thyroid carcinoma, and a patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue, and six patients achieved time to progression of>6 months, including patients with thyroid carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of anti-IGF-1R antibody cixutumumab and MEK 1/2 inhibitor selumetinib showed that the combination is safe and well-tolerated at these doses, with preliminary evidence of clinical benefit and pharmacodynamic evidence of target inhibition. MHC class I loss is a frequent mechanism of immune escape in papillary thyroid cancer that is reversed by interferon and selumetinib treatment in vitro. Increased antigenicity following selumetinib and IFN treatment warrants further study for immunotherapy of progressive PTC. The role of KIs in differentiated TC may be revolutionised by the finding that selumetinib may restore a clinical response to radioactive iodine (RAI).  BACKGROUND AND AIM: Selumetinib is a promising and interesting targeted therapy agent as it may reverse radioiodine uptake in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with current chemotherapy, selumetinib has modest clinical activity as monotherapy in patients with advanced cancer, but combinations of selumetinib with cytotoxic agents in patients with BRAF or KRAS mutations hold great promise for cancer treatment. Selumetinib may be an effective redifferentiating agent and could be used within several years. Selumetinib-enhanced radioiodine uptake in advanced thyroid cancer. METHODS: We conducted a study to determine whether the MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and MEK2 inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) could reverse refractoriness to radioiodine in patients with metastatic thyroid cancer.  Selumetinib increased the uptake of iodine-124 in 12 of the 20 patients (4 of 9 patients with BRAF mutations and 5 of 5 patients with NRAS mutations). CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib produces clinically meaningful increases in iodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioiodine; the effectiveness may be greater in patients with RAS-mutant disease.  ECENT FINDINGS: For patients with advanced differentiated thyroid cancers, sorafenib, selumetinib, pazopanib and sunitinib have been investigated with promising results.  Selumetinib is a promising and interesting targeted therapy agent as it may reverse radioiodine uptake in patients with radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. Selumetinib may be an effective redifferentiating agent and could be used within several years. Here, selumetinib targets the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in papillary thyroid carcinoma and shows limited single-agent activity in the patients with tumors that harbor the (V600E)BRAF mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Selumetinib produces clinically meaningful increases in iodine uptake and retention in a subgroup of patients with thyroid cancer that is refractory to radioiodine; the effectiveness may be greater in patients with RAS-mutant disease. 	yes
394	531b4269b166e2b80600003e	Is thyroid hormone therapy indicated in patients with heart failure?	Patients with chronic heart failure and subclinical hypothyroidism significantly improved their physical performance when normal TSH levels were reached. Early and sustained physiological restoration of circulating L-T3 levels after MI halves infarct scar size and prevents the progression towards heart failure. This beneficial effect is likely due to enhanced capillary formation and mitochondrial protection. These data indicate that T(3) replacement to euthyroid levels improves systolic function and tends to improve diastolic function, potentially through changes in myocardial gene expression. In these patients, the administration of synthetic triiodothyronine (T(3)) was well tolerated and induced significant improvement in cardiac function without increased heart rate and metabolic demand. In DC patients, short-term synthetic L-T(3) replacement therapy significantly improved neuroendocrine profile and ventricular performance. Triiodothyronine was well tolerated without episodes of ischemia or clinical arrhythmia. There was no significant change in heart rate or metabolic rate and there was minimal increase in core temperature. Cardiac output increased with a reduction in systemic vascular resistance in patients receiving the largest dose, consistent with a peripheral vasodilatory effect.	no

Cyclophosphamide promotes engraftment of gene-modified cells in a mouse model of Fanconi anemia without causing cytogenetic abnormalities We compared Cy preconditioning with fludarabine (Flu) or cytarabine (AraC) or no conditioning as a control in fanca ( -/- ) mutant mice receiving gene-modified bone marrow cells We conclude that Cy is an effective and superior preparative regimen with respect to engraftment of lentivirus-transduced cells and functional correction in fanca ( -/- ) mice To study whether there is a causal relationship between FA pathway defects and tumour development, we have generated a mouse model with a targeted disruption of the FA core complex gene Fancf Fancf-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts displayed a phenotype typical for FA cells: they showed an aberrant response to DNA cross-linking agents as manifested by G(2) arrest, chromosomal aberrations, reduced survival, and an inability to monoubiquitinate FANCD2 Fancf homozygous mice were viable, born following a normal Mendelian distribution, and showed no growth retardation or developmental abnormalities. The gonads of Fancf mutant mice functioned abnormally, showing compromised follicle development and spermatogenesis as has been observed in other FA mouse models and in FA patients In a cohort of Fancf-deficient mice, we observed decreased overall survival and increased tumour incidence To provide further experimental access to the FA-M complementation group we have generated Fancm-deficient mice by deleting exon 2 FANCM deficiency caused hypogonadism in mice and hypersensitivity to cross-linking agents in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), thus phenocopying other FA mouse models Fancm(Delta2/Delta2) mice also showed unique features atypical for FA mice, including underrepresentation of female Fancm(Delta2/Delta2) mice and decreased overall and tumor-free survival Fancm-deficient mice reveal unique features of Fanconi anemia complementation group M Fancf-deficient mice are prone to develop ovarian tumours In vivo proliferation advantage of genetically corrected hematopoietic stem cells in a mouse model of Fanconi anemia FA-D1 Using an FA mouse model with a marked hematopoietic phenotype, the FA-D1 (Brca2(Delta27/Delta27)) mice, we demonstrate that the lentivirus-mediated gene therapy of FA HSCs results in the progressive expansion of genetically corrected clones in mild-conditioned FA-D1 recipients Consistent with these data, hematopoietic progenitors from FA recipients progressively became mitomycin C resistant and their chromosomal instability was reverted Hematopoietic dysfunction in a mouse model for Fanconi anemia group D1 We have investigated the hematopoietic phenotype of mice with a hypomorphic mutation in the Brca2/Fancd1 gene (Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) mutation) Conventional BM competition experiments showed a marked repopulation defect in Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), compared to wild-type HSCs Moreover, we have observed for the first time in a DNA repair disease model a very significant proliferation defect in Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) HSCs maintained in their natural physiological environment The hematopoietic phenotype associated with the Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) mutation suggests that this FA-D1 mouse model will constitute an important tool for the development of new therapies for FA, including gene therapy In vitro phenotypic correction of hematopoietic progenitors from Fanconi anemia group A knockout mice In this study we characterized the hematopoietic phenotype of a Fanca knockout mouse model and corrected the main phenotypic characteristics of the bone marrow (BM) progenitors using retroviral vectors The hematopoiesis of these animals was characterized by a modest though significant thrombocytopenia, consistent with reduced numbers of BM megakaryocyte progenitors As observed in other FA models, the hematopoietic progenitors from Fanca(-/-) mice were highly sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC) Aiming to correct the phenotype of Fanca(-/-) progenitors, purified Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells were transduced with retroviral vectors encoding the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene and human FANCA genes. Lin(-)Sca-1(+) cells from Fanca(-/-) mice were transduced with an efficiency similar to that of samples from wild-type mice. More significantly, transductions with FANCA vectors corrected both the MMC hypersensitivity as well as the impaired ex vivo expansion ability that characterized the BM progenitors of Fanca(-/-) mice  The Btbd12 knockout mouse therefore establishes a disease model for Fanconi anemia and genetically links a regulator of nuclease incision complexes to the Fanconi anemia DNA crosslink repair pathway.

Five of these genes have been deleted or mutated in the mouse, as well as a sixth key regulatory gene, to create mouse models of Fanconi anemia. This review summarizes the phenotype of each of the Fanconi anemia mouse models and highlights how genetic and interventional studies using the strains have yielded novel insight into therapeutic strategies for Fanconi anemia and into how the Fanconi anemia pathway protects against genomic instability. To study FA complementation group A using the mouse as a model system, we cloned and characterized the mouse homolog of the human FANCA cDNA. Here we describe the phenotype of the Btbd12 knockout mouse, the mouse ortholog of SLX4, which recapitulates many key features of the human genetic illness Fanconi anemia. Five of these genes have been deleted or mutated in the mouse, as well as a sixth key regulatory gene, to create mouse models of Fanconi anemia In contrast to observations made in other Fanconi anemia (FA) mouse models, low numbers of hematopoietic colony-forming cells (CFCs) were noted in Brca2(Delta27/Delta27) mice, either young or adult Fanconi anemia group A and C double-mutant mice: functional evidence for a multi-protein Fanconi anemia complex.

We demonstrated that the treatment of several human cancer cell lines with therapeutical doses of WR-1065 led to a strong induction of different VEGF-A mRNA isoforms independently of HIF-1alpha e investigated the involvement of hypoxia-regulated proteins (Hypoxia inducible factors HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and carbonic anhydrase CA9) in HNC resistance to accelerated and hypofractionated radiotherapy In accord with previously reported studies, high levels of the hypoxia regulated proteins HIF1alpha and CA9 in HNC predict resistance to platinum based radio-chemotherapy. Whether HIF2alpha expressing tumors are more sensitive to larger radiotherapy fractions, compared to standard radiotherapy fractionation, is an issue that deserves further investigation. HIF1alpha and HIF2alpha were expressed in the nuclei and cytoplasm of cancer cells, while CA9 had a membrane reactivity. A high expression of HIF1alpha, HIF2alpha and CA9 was noted in 21/39 (53.8%), 20/39 (51.3%) and 23/39 (58.9%) cases, respectively. Complete response was obtained in 85.2% of patients and HIF1alpha was marginally related with persistent disease after RT (p = 0.05). HIF1alpha was significantly associated with poor local relapse free survival (LRFS) (p = 0.006) and overall survival (p = 0.008), whilst HIF2alpha was no  The glucose and oxygen levels in the peripheral blood of patients receiving 1000 mg amifostine were determined at various time-points in order to investigate the metabolic changes induced by amifostine. MDA468 breast tumor cell lines were incubated with a high amifostine concentration (10 m M) to overcome the natural resistance of cancer cells to influx of the non-hydrolyzed WR-2721, and the HIF1 alpha protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis Since it is doubtful whether dephosphorylation of amifostine to the active metabolite WR-1065 occurs within tumoral tissues (an acidic environment that lacks vascular alkaline phosphatase activity), intracellular hypoxia and upregulation of HIF1 alpha represents an additional, normal tissue-specific, amifostine cytoprotective pathway. .

424	55413142182542114d000002	Are ultraconserved elements depleted among copy number variants (CNVs)?	We have demonstrated that nonexonic UCEs are depleted among segmental duplications (SDs) and copy number variants (CNVs) and proposed that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison. Here, we report that nonexonic UCEs are also depleted among 10 of 11 recent genomewide data sets of human CNVs, including 3 obtained with strategies permitting greater precision in determining the extents of CNVs Interestingly, human UCEs have been reported to be strongly depleted among segmental duplications and benign copy number variants (CNVs) We propose that these elements may be interpreted as hallmarks for dose-sensitive genes, particularly for those genes whose gain or loss may be directly implied in neurodevelopmental disorders. Therefore, their presence in genomic imbalances of unknown effect might be suggestive of a clinically relevant condition Mammalian ultraconserved elements are strongly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants.

425	5156be5ed24251bc05000087	Is the microRNA 132 (miR-132) involved in brain pathologies?	miR-132 dysregulation and subsequent abnormal expression of miR-132 target genes contribute to the neurodevelopmental and neuromorphological pathologies present in schizophrenia. micro-RNAs encoding miR-9, miR-124a, miR-125b, miR-128, miR-132 and miR-219 are abundantly represented in fetal hippocampus, are differentially regulated in aged brain, and an alteration in specific micro-RNA complexity occurs in Alzheimer hippocampus. These data are consistent with the idea that altered micro-RNA-mediated processing of messenger RNA populations may contribute to atypical mRNA abundance and neural dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease brain. Levels of several microRNA (miR-10a, -10b, -212, -132, -495) were significantly altered. One of them (miR-132) has been reported to be highly inducible by growth factors and to be a key regulator of neurite outgrowth. Moreover, miR-132-recognition sequences were detected in the mRNA transcripts of two differentially expressed proteins. MicroRNA may thus represent novel biomarkers for neuronal malfunction and potential therapeutic targets for human neurodegenerative diseases. Expression of key neuronal microRNAs-including mir-9/9*, mir-124 and mir-132-is repressed in the brains of human HD patients and mouse models. To determine if production of miR-132 is regulated by neuronal activity its expression in mouse brain was monitored by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) Expression levels of primary and mature-miR-132 increased significantly between postnatal Days 10 and 24. We conclude that miR-132 is an activity-dependent microRNA in vivo, and may contribute to the long-lasting proteomic changes required for experience-dependent neuronal plasticity. We investigated how prior seizure preconditioning affects the miRNA response to status epilepticus evoked by intra-amygdalar kainic acid in mice. Increased miR-132 levels were matched with increased binding to Argonaute-2, a constituent of the RNA-induced silencing complex. In tolerant animals, expression responses of >40% of the injury-group-detected miRNAs differed, being either unchanged relative to control or down-regulated, and this included miR-132. In vivo microinjection of locked nucleic acid-modified oligonucleotides (antagomirs) against miR-132 depleted hippocampal miR-132 levels and reduced seizure-induced neuronal death. Thus, our data strongly suggest that miRNAs are important regulators of seizure-induced neuronal death. Preconditioning describes the ischemic stimulus that triggers an endogenous, neuroprotective response that protects the brain during a subsequent severe ischemic injury, a phenomenon known as 'tolerance'. Downregulation of miR-132 is consistent with our finding that preconditioning ischemia induces a rapid increase in MeCP2 protein, but not mRNA, in mouse cortex. These studies reveal that ischemic preconditioning regulates expression of miRNAs and their predicted targets in mouse brain cortex, and further suggest that miRNAs and MeCP2 could serve as effectors of ischemic preconditioning-induced tolerance. Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic neurodegenerative disease caused by abnormal CAG expansion. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNA molecules regulating gene expression, and are implicated in a variety of diseases including HD. Nine miRNAs (miR-22, miR-29c, miR-128, miR-132, miR-138, miR-218, miR-222, miR-344, and miR-674*) were commonly down-regulated in both the 12-month-old YAC128 and 10-week-old R6/2 mice. transgenic HD mice have abnormal miRNA biogenesis. This information should aid in future studies on therapeutic application of miRNAs in HD. miR-132 directly targets the neuronal splicing factor polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2), which protein levels were increased in PSP patients. miR-132 overexpression or PTBP2 knockdown similarly affected endogenous 4R:3R-tau ratios in neuronal cells. Finally, we provide evidence that miR-132 is inversely correlated with PTBP2 during post-natal brain development at the time when 4R-tau becomes expressed. Taken together, these results suggest that changes in the miR-132/PTBP2 pathway could contribute to the abnormal splicing of tau exon 10 in the brain, and sheds light into the potential role played by miRNAs in a subset of tauopathies. reports of microRNA (miR) modulators of both neuronal and immune processes (here termed NeurimmiRs) predict therapeutic potential for manipulating NeurimmiR levels in diseases affecting both the immune system and higher brain functions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and anxiety-related disorders. In our opinion, NeurimmiRs that function within both the nervous and the immune systems, such as miR-132 and miR-124, may act as 'negotiators' between these two interacting compartments.	yes

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is the commonest red cell enzymopathy in humans and has an X-linked inheritance.  This genetic defect shows sex linked inheritance and a marked heterogeneity. G6PD deficiency is the most common enzymopathy in the world.  Study of the deficiency pattern amongst family members of the enzyme deficient subjects confirmed the X-linked inheritance of G-6-PD deficiency.

456	5896399978275d0c4a00000b	Is RASA2 involved in melanoma?	Analysis of 501 melanoma exomes identified RASA2, encoding a RasGAP, as a tumor-suppressor gene mutated in 5% of melanomas. Recurrent loss-of-function mutations in RASA2 were found to increase RAS activation, melanoma cell growth and migration.

If patient is not improved, then Adalimumab 160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2; then 40 mg subcutaneously weekly should be administered (LOE Ib, SOR A). If improvement occurs then therapy should be maintained as long as HS lesions are present. Reduction in pain scores and improvement in depressive symptoms in patients with hidradenitis suppurativa treated with adalimumab in a phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Adalimumab treatment for 16 weeks improved HS lesions significantly versus placebo (NCT00918255). CONCLUSION: Patients with moderate to severe HS had a high degree of pain and depressive symptoms at baseline. Adalimumabtherapy was associated with decreased pain and depressive symptoms compared to baseline. Spotlight on adalimumab in the treatment of active moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa. Adalimumab, a recombinant, fully humanized, anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-α) monoclonal antibody, is the only officially approved treatment for the management of moderate-to-severe HS. Case reports, concerning 42 patients who received adalimumab for severe HS (with the standard dose regimen for psoriasis), reported a cumulative response rate of 58% (≥50% in 23 patients) with a relapse rate of 71% (10 out of 14 patients). The most recent and most well-powered phase III, randomized placebo-controlled trials for the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in treatment of moderate-to-severe HS (PIONEER studies I and II) showed that the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) rate at week 12 was significantly higher for patients randomized to adalimumab compared to placebo. In conclusion, adalimumab, to date, holds the most robust data regarding treatment efficacy in HS.  Adalimumab (Humira) for the Treatment of Hidradenitis Suppurativa. Adalimumab (Humira®) is a novel therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, Health Canada, and the European Commission for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).

470	5886222a3b87a8a738000005	Can NEECHAM Confusion Scale be used for evaluation of postoperative delirium?	Sampling was achieved in a nonrandomized targeted manner and delirium was assessed using NeeCham questionnaire.  Delirium in older patients: a diagnostic study of NEECHAM Confusion Scale in surgical intensive care unit. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To estimate the diagnostic value and determine the feasibility of the NEECHAM Confusion Scale on critically ill older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study confirm the good diagnostic value and ease of application of the NEECHAM scale with nonventilated intensive care patients.RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The NEECHAM scale can be used to detect delirium during the routine nursing assessment of nonintubated older patients as it requires minimal demand and stress on the patient as well as on the bedside nurse. The NEECHAM Confusion Scale and the validated chart review instrument were used for diagnosis of delirium.  Among the various screening instruments, NEECHAM confusion scale and delirium observation scale appear to be most suitable screening instrument for patients' in general medical and surgical wards, depending on the type of rater (physician or nurse).  Use of NEECHAM scaling enabled medical staff to identify cases of possible confusion early, indicating that the NEECHAM confusion scale should be useful for the detection of postoperative delirium and confusion in the surgical ward. Early detection of postoperative delirium and confusion in a surgical ward using the NEECHAM confusion scale. In this study, we investigated whether the early detection of postoperative delirium in elderly patients is possible using a simple, useful behavior-assessing scale, the NEECHAM Confusion Scale, and a method for comprehensively evaluating elderly persons' stress related to surgery, E-PASS. Assessment of the risk of postoperative delirium in elderly patients using E-PASS and the NEECHAM Confusion Scale. The aim of this study was to determine which of the two delirium observation screening scales, the NEECHAM Confusion Scale or the Delirium Observation Screening (DOS) scale, has the best discriminative capacity for diagnosing delirium and which is more practical for daily use by nurses. For delirium diagnosis and severity assessment, we used the NEECHAM Confusion Scale. Use of NEECHAM scaling enabled medical staff to identify cases of possible confusion early, indicating that the NEECHAM confusion scale should be useful for the detection of postoperative delirium and confusion in the surgical ward. The NEECHAM Confusion Scale was performed upon admission and prior to discharge.RESULTS: The incidence of DSM-IV related delirium was 24%. A comparison of the CAM-ICU and the NEECHAM Confusion Scale in intensive care delirium assessment: an observational study in non-intubated patients. Predictive value and validation of the NEECHAM Confusion Scale using DSM-IV criteria for delirium as gold standard. Early detection of postoperative delirium and confusion in a surgical ward using the NEECHAM confusion scale The aim of this study was to determine which of the two delirium observation screening scales, the NEECHAM Confusion Scale or the Delirium Observation Screening (DOS) scale, has the best discriminative capacity for diagnosing delirium and which is more practical for daily use by nurses.The project was conducted on four wards of a university hospital; 87 patients were included In addition, we scored the participants on the NEECHAM Scale and evaluated their postoperative delirium and postoperative arrhythmia.On the nights of Days 4 and 5, the amount of activity of the exposure group was significantly lower and The sympathetic nervous index was significantly lower on the night of Day 5 In this study, we investigated whether the early detection of postoperative delirium in elderly patients is possible using a simple, useful behavior-assessing scale, the NEECHAM Confusion Scale, and a method for comprehensively evaluating elderly persons' stress related to surgery, E-PASS.  The cut-off value of the NEECHAM score was established as 20 points, and patients showing values less than this after surgery were regarded as having postoperative delirium.  Identification of delirium was based on evaluation of the level of consciousness with the NEECHAM Confusion Scale and/or a chart-based instrument for delirium. For delirium diagnosis and severity assessment, we used the NEECHAM Confusion Scale. In this study, we investigated whether the early detection of postoperative delirium in elderly patients is possible using a simple, useful behavior-assessing scale, the NEECHAM Confusion Scale, and a method for comprehensively evaluating elderly persons' stress related to surgery, E-PASS.The subjects were 160 patients aged more than 75 years who underwent surgery. In this study a nursing screening instrument, the NEECHAM confusion scale, was studied for early recognition of delirium ICU patients. The psychometric characteristics and the ease of use of the NEECHAM confusion scale enables ICU nurses to early recognize delirium. The trends of the NEECHAM scores in the 3 groups were compared, and the relationship between the NEECHAM scores and suspected clinical risk factors for delirium was investigated. In groups showing an MMSE score of less than 25 or a preoperative NEECHAM score of less than 27, the incidence of postoperative delirium was 76%.CONCLUSION: The results suggest that E-PASS and the NEECHAM score facilitate assessment of the risk of postoperative delirium in elderly patients, contributing to early prevention/treatment. In this study, we investigated whether the early detection of postoperative delirium in elderly patients is possible using a simple, useful behavior-assessing scale, the NEECHAM Confusion Scale, and a method for comprehensively evaluating elderly persons' stress related to surgery, E-PASS.

474	588f5e9994c1512c50000004	Is there any tool that facilitates the functional analysis of cis-regulatory regions in zebrafish?	Zebrafish enhancer detection (ZED) vector: a new tool to facilitate transgenesis and the functional analysis of cis-regulatory regions in zebrafish. he cis-regulatory sequences control when, where, and how much genes are transcribed and can activate (enhancers) or repress (silencers) gene expression. Here, we describe a novel Tol2 transposon-based vector for assessing enhancer activity in the zebrafish (Danio rerio). This Zebrafish Enhancer Detector (ZED) vector harbors several key improvements, among them a sensitive and specific minimal promoter chosen for optimal enhancer activity detection, insulator sequences to shield the minimal promoter from position effects, and a positive control for transgenesis. Additionally, we demonstrate that highly conserved noncoding sequences homologous between humans and zebrafish largely with enhancer activity largely retain their tissue-specific enhancer activity during vertebrate evolution. More strikingly, insulator sequences from mouse and chicken, but not conserved in zebrafish, maintain their insulator capacity when tested in this model.

493	5896e4d478275d0c4a000015	Is golimumab effective for ulcerative colitis?	Initial experience with golimumab in clinical practice for ulcerative colitis. BACKGROUND: Golimumab is a TNF-blocking agent indicated as a second-line therapy in ulcerative colitis. CONCLUSIONS: In this short study, golimumab seems to be an alternative treatment in naive and non-naive anti-TNF ulcerative colitis patients. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of 1-Year Treatment with Golimumab/Standard Care and Standard Care Alone for Ulcerative Colitis in Poland. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of induction and maintenance treatment up to 1 year of ulcerative colitis with golimumab/standard care and standard care alone in Poland. CONCLUSIONS: The biologic treatment of ulcerative colitis patients with golimumab/standard care is more effective but also more costly compared with standard care alone. Currently, infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are available in the East Asian medical market, and these agents have been shown to be effective for inducing and maintaining long-term remission of IBD. Furthermore, upcoming treatments are introduced, such as golimumab, vedolizumab, AJM300, tofacitinib. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in efficacy in the maintenance phase between infliximab and golimumab or adalimumab were revealed. Infliximab proved to be more effective than adalimumab but of similar efficacy to that of golimumab in the induction phase. In this review, we will provide a detailed discussion of the three tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors currently approved for treatment of ulcerative colitis: infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab.

519	58e11bf76fddd3e83e00000c	Are mutations in the C9orf72  gene associated with macular degeneration?	Over the years, however, growing evidence from clinical, pathological and genetic findings has suggested that ALS and FTD belong to the same clinic-pathological spectrum disorder. This concept has been further supported by the identification of the most common genetic cause for both diseases, an aberrantly expanded hexanucleotide repeat GGGGCC/ CCCCGG sequence located in a non-coding region of the gene C9orf72. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by motor neurone loss resulting in muscle weakness, spasticity and ultimately death. 5-10% are caused by inherited mutations, most commonly C9ORF72, SOD1, TARDBP and FUS. In this article, we will review the brief characterizations of the C9ORF72 gene, the expansion mutations, the related disorders, and their features, followed by a discussion of the deficiency knowledge of C9ORF72 mutations. Mutations in the C9ORF72 gene may be a major cause not only of frontotemporal dementia with motor neuron disease but also of late onset psychosis. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a genetically heterogenous syndrome and has been associated most recently with a hexanucleotide repeat expansion within the C9ORF72 gene. An expanded GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat in C9ORF72 is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration associated with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP). Novel TARDBP sequence variant and C9ORF72 repeat expansion in a family with frontotemporal dementia. There was, as expected, a significant association between C9ORF72 mutations and presence of motor neuron disease. Expansion of a hexanucleotide repeat in the C9ORF72 gene has been identified as the most common pathogenic mutation in families with autosomal dominant frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. C9ORF72 hexanucleotide repeat number in frontotemporal lobar degeneration: a genotype-phenotype correlation study. Hexanucleotide repeat expansions in chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72) have recently been linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and may be the most common genetic cause of both neurodegenerative diseases. studies recently identified a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in a non-coding region of the chromosome 9 open-reading frame 72 gene (C9ORF72) as the cause of chromosome 9p-linked amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

540	589a245478275d0c4a000022	Is intraoperative radiotherapy used for treatment of glioblastoma?	 1) Intraoperative radiotherapy ( IOR , 1,000-2,000 rad) was applied in 13 cases; the 2-year survival was 41.6%.  The median survival time after IORT was 12 months for 9 patients with glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma, while it was 51 months for 8 patients with less infiltrative tumors (ependymoma, anaplastic ependymoma, and anaplastic oligodendroglioma).  It is concluded that IORT combined with extensive tumor removal has an acceptable toxicity in previously irradiated patients and can be effective for selected recurrent malignant brain tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that IORT can contribute to successful tumor treatment while neither increasing peri-operative morbidity nor subacute sequelae. This review compiles preclinical and clinical evidence for a dedicated treatment of both residual cancer cells and regional microenvironment using intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT).  Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is a pragmatic and effective approach to sterilize the margins from persistent tumor cells, abrogate post-injury proliferative stimuli and to bridge the therapeutic gap between surgery and radiochemotherapy.

547	5881e8e8713cbdfd3d000003	Is Pfh1 a component of the replisome?	Pfh1 Is an Accessory Replicative Helicase that Interacts with the Replisome to Facilitate Fork Progression and Preserve Genome Integrity Although the Schizosaccharomyces pombe 5'-to-3' DNA helicase Pfh1 is known to promote fork progression, its genomic targets, dynamics, and mechanisms of action are largely unknown. Here we address these questions by integrating genome-wide identification of Pfh1 binding sites, comprehensive analysis of the effects of Pfh1 depletion on replication and DNA damage, and proteomic analysis of Pfh1 interaction partners by immunoaffinity purification mass spectrometry. DNA replication through hard-to-replicate sites, including both highly transcribed RNA Pol II and Pol III genes, requires the S. pombe Pfh1 helicase. Here, we show that Pfh1 is required for efficient fork movement in the ribosomal DNA, the mating type locus, tRNA, 5S ribosomal RNA genes, and genes that are highly transcribed by RNA polymerase II.   Thus, Pfh1 promotes DNA replication and separation of converged replication forks and suppresses DNA damage at hard-to-replicate sites. Cells depleted of Pfh1 were inviable if they also lacked the human TIMELESS homolog Swi1, a replisome component that stabilizes stalled forks. Pfh1 Is an Accessory Replicative Helicase that Interacts with the Replisome to Facilitate Fork Progression and Preserve Genome Integrity. Thus, we conclude that Pfh1 is an accessory DNA helicase that interacts with the replisome and promotes replication and suppresses DNA damage at hard-to-replicate sites. Consistent with this interpretation, Pfh1 co-purified with many key replisome components, including the hexameric MCM helicase, replicative DNA polymerases, RPA, and the processivity clamp PCNA in an S phase dependent manner. Although Pfh1 affected replication and suppressed DNA damage at discrete sites throughout the genome, Pfh1 and the replicative DNA polymerase bound to similar extents to both Pfh1-dependent and independent sites, suggesting that Pfh1 is proximal to the replication machinery during S phase. Cells depleted of Pfh1 were inviable if they also lacked the human TIMELESS homolog Swi1, a replisome component that stabilizes stalled forks Here, we show that Pfh1 is required for efficient fork movement in the ribosomal DNA, the mating type locus, tRNA, 5S ribosomal RNA genes, and genes that are highly transcribed by RNA polymerase II Thus, Pfh1 promotes DNA replication and separation of converged replication forks and suppresses DNA damage at hard-to-replicate sites Cells depleted of Pfh1 were inviable if they also lacked the human TIMELESS homolog Swi1, a replisome component that stabilizes stalled forks.

These findings collectively indicate that MPE-seq provides a unique and straightforward means for the genome-wide analysis of chromatin structure with minimal DNA sequence bias. Micrococcal nuclease does not substantially bias nucleosome mapping. MNase has hitherto been very widely used to map nucleosomes, although concerns have been raised over its potential to introduce bias. These results indicate that biases in nucleosome positioning data collected using MNase are, under our conditions, not significant. Signal variation in these simulations reveals an important DNA sampling bias that results from a neighborhood effect of MNase digestion techniques. Standardized collection of MNase-seq experiments enables unbiased dataset comparisons. Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the resulting fragments. We propose that combined MNase/exoIII digestion can be applied to in situ chromatin for unbiased genome-wide mapping of nucleosome positions that is not influenced by DNA sequences at the core/linker junctions. Signal variation in these simulations reveals an important DNA sampling bias that results from a neighborhood effect of MNase digestion techniques.

These results indicate that biases in nucleosome positioning data collected using MNase are, under our conditions, not significant.. Micrococcal nuclease does not substantially bias nucleosome mapping. We find that maize MNase-hypersensitive (MNase HS) regions localize around active genes and within recombination hotspots, focusing biased gene conversion at their flanks.	yes

603	5a8965f6fcd1d6a10c000005	Are splicing speckles associated with transcription?	"We show here that RNA splicing speckled domains (splicing speckles) fluctuate in constrained nuclear volumes and remodel their shapes. We present a model where recycling splicing factors return as part of small sub-speckles from distal sites of RNA processing to larger splicing speckles by a directed ATP-driven mechanism through interchromatin spaces. Analysis of a HeLa cell line stably expressing EYFP-NHPX showed that the nucleolar accumulation of NHPX was preceded by its transient accumulation in splicing speckles. In vivo analysis of NHPX reveals a novel nucleolar localization pathway involving a transient accumulation in splicing speckles. ""Splicing speckles"" are major nuclear domains rich in components of the splicing machinery and polyA(+) RNA. Although speckles contain little detectable transcriptional activity, they are found preferentially associated with specific mRNA-coding genes and gene-rich R bands, and they accumulate some unspliced pre-mRNAs RNA polymerase II transcribes mRNAs and is required for splicing, with some reports suggesting that the inactive complexes are stored in splicing speckle In normal cell growth conditions GFPeIF4A-III was mainly nucleoplasmic, but in hypoxia stress conditions it moved to the nucleolus and splicing speckles. Localization of eIF4A-III in the nucleolus and splicing speckles is an indicator of plant stress.  Using antibodies raised against mouse RBM6 to immunostain mammalian cell lines we found that the endogenous protein was both distributed diffusely in the nucleus and concentrated in a small number of nuclear foci that corresponded to splicing speckles/interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs Subnuclear targeting of the RNA-binding motif protein RBM6 to splicing speckles and nascent transcripts."	no
617	5a7615af83b0d9ea6600001f	Is vorinostat effective for glioblastoma?	Conclusions: Vorinostat combined with standard chemoradiation had acceptable tolerability in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Although the primary efficacy endpoint was not met, vorinostat sensitivity and resistance signatures could facilitate patient selection in future trials. LESSONS LEARNED: Combination regimen with bevacizumab (BEV) and vorinostat is well tolerated in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. CONCLUSION: Combination treatment of BEV and VOR was well tolerated. This combination therapy for this study population did not improve PFS6 or median OS when compared with BEV monotherapy. We present two patients with glioblastoma multiforme who developed severe hemolytic anemia shortly after initiating therapy with vorinostat, a pan-active histone deacetylase inhibitor, while on prophylactic dapsone. Vorinostat is the most advanced HDAC inhibitor that entered clinical trials in glioblastoma, showing activity in recurrent disease. Multiple phase II trials with vorinostat in combination with targeted agents, temozolomide and radiotherapy are currently recruiting.  . On the basis of the results of this phase II study, further evaluation of the vorinostat-bortezomib combination in GBM patients in this dose and schedule is not recommended. ith the increased toxicities associated with CPT-11 coupled with its unclear clinical significance, investigating the efficacy of vorinostat combined with bevacizumab alone may represent a more promising strategy to evaluate in the context of a phase II clinical trial. CONCLUSION: Vorinostat in combination with temozolomide is well tolerated in patients with HGG. A phase I/II trial of vorinostat with radiotherapy and concomitant TMZ in newly diagnosed glioblastoma is underway.	no
619	5a6f87c5b750ff4455000056	Are patients with Sjogren syndrome at increased risk for lymphoma?	The heightened risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) development in primary Sjogren syndrome (SS) is well established. Primary Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma of the Liver in a Patient with Sjogren Syndrome. Immunohistochemical and molecular features of the tumors allowed diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).  To our knowledge, the patient described here represents the first reported case of DLBCL with primary liver involvement in SS. Rituximab is also effective in the treatment of SS-associated (extrasalivary) lymphomas, although the therapeutic response in salivary lymphoma is poorer. Rituximab treatment for Sjogren syndrome-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: case series. Five per cent of patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) develop malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), usually of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) and most frequently located in the major salivary glands.  [A case of Sjogren syndrome coexistent with MALT lymphoma occurring along the parotid gland and trachea]. Both histological examinations revealed MALT-type marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.  In the majority of patients, it is a late event and frequently associated with systemic disease or risk factors for lymphoma development. The incidence of lymphoma is higher in patients with Sjögren's syndrome than in the general population. Among the clinical and serological parameters that have been associated with lymphoma development in SS patients, the presence of palpable purpura, low C4, and mixed monoclonal cryoglobulinemia constitute the main predictive markers, and patients displaying these risk factors should be monitored closely. A case of pulmonary pseudolymphoma and Sjogren syndrome is presented. Furthermore, RA, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, and possibly celiac disease may share an association with risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in addition to well-established links of Sjögren's syndrome with risk of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and of celiac disease with risk of small intestinal lymphoma. Predicting the risk for lymphoma development in Sjogren syndrome: An easy tool for clinical use. Lymphoma is a very severe complication of primary Sjögren's syndrome: 5 to 10% of patients followed for more than 10 years will develop a lymphoma. Hematologic manifestations and predictors of lymphoma development in primary Sjögren syndrome: clinical and pathophysiologic aspects. Recent results clearly indicate an association between severity of chronic inflammation and lymphoma risk in RA and Sjögren's syndrome. Several autoimmune diseases, including primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), are associated with an increased risk for lymphoma. Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) confers increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) development. Furthermore, we review the emerging role of ELS and lymphoid chemokines in driving extranodal B cell lymphomagenesis in SS and we focus on recent evidence suggesting that ELS identify subsets of SS patients at increased risk of developing systemic manifestations and lymphoma. Sjogren's syndrome (SS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder with the highest risk for lymphoma development among all autoimmune diseases. In contrast to secondary SS, the risk for developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is highly increased in patients with primary SS. Predicting the risk for lymphoma development in Sjogren syndrome: An easy tool for clinical use. Primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) is complicated by B-cell lymphoma in 5-10% of patients. Patients with Sjögren syndrome are at increased risk of lymphoma development. Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease with a known predisposition for lymphoma development. Certain autoimmune and chronic inflammatory conditions, such as Sjögren's syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), have consistently been associated with an increased risk of malignant lymphomas, but it is unclear whether elevated lymphoma risk is a phenomenon that accompanies inflammatory conditions in general.	yes

We previously discovered the downregulation of T-UCR expression in gastric cancer (GC), indicating that T-UCRs could play an important role in GC biology. Uc.160+, a T-UCR reported to be downregulated in human cancer, has not been examined in GC.METHODS: We analyzed the expression pattern of Uc.160+ in nonneoplastic and tumor tissues of the stomach by using uantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH), specifically focusing on the mechanism of transcriptional regulation and target genes that are regulated by T-UCRs. We also attempted to determine the effect of Uc.160+ expression on biological features of GC cell lines by Western blotting.RESULTS: On the basis of the qRT-PCR and ISH results, Uc.160+ expression in adenoma and GC tissues was clearly downregulated compared with that in nonneoplastic mucosa tissues of the stomach. Cancer-specific DNA methylation in the promoter region of Uc.160 was observed by bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing analysis.

652	58ec6eb5eda5a5767200000c	Is Enlimomab effective for stroke treatment?	However, this treatment failed to show benefit in the Enlimomab Acute Stroke Trial. There was no increase in the frequency of adverse events with increasing doses of enlimomab.CONCLUSIONS: Doses of enlimomab between 140 and 480 mg administered over 5 days did not increase the risk of adverse events in patients with ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke during an observation period of 30 +/- 10 days. Examination of several potential mechanisms for the negative outcome in a clinical stroke trial of enlimomab, a murine anti-human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 antibody: a bedside-to-bench study. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enlimomab, a murine monoclonal anti-human intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 antibody, had a negative outcome in a multicenter acute-stroke trial.  These observations provide several possible mechanisms for central nervous system-related clinical deterioration that occurred when Enlimomab was given in acute ischemic stroke. Fewer patients had symptom-free recovery on enlimomab than placebo (p = 0.004), and more died (22.2 versus 16.2%). The negative effect of enlimomab was apparent on days 5, 30, and 90 of treatment (p = 0.005). There were significantly more adverse events with enlimomab treatment than placebo, primarily infections and fever.  CONCLUSIONS: The authors conclude that anti-ICAM therapy with enlimomab is not an effective treatment for ischemic stroke in the model studied and, indeed, may significantly worsen stroke outcome. Patients experiencing fever were more likely to have a poor outcome or die.The authors conclude that anti-ICAM therapy with enlimomab is not an effective treatment for ischemic stroke in the model studied and, indeed, may significantly worsen stroke outcome.

658	5abd3707fcf456587200002d	Is the petrous bone used in ancient DNA sampling?	Large-scale genomic analyses of ancient human populations have become feasible partly due to refined sampling methods. The inner part of petrous bones and the cementum layer in teeth roots are currently recognized as the best substrates for such research. Ancient DNA (aDNA) research involves invasive and destructive sampling procedures that are often incompatible with anthropological, anatomical, and bioarcheological analyses requiring intact skeletal remains. The osseous labyrinth inside the petrous bone has been shown to yield higher amounts of endogenous DNA than any other skeletal element; however, accessing this labyrinth in cases of a complete or reconstructed skull involves causing major structural damage to the cranial vault or base. first genome-wide ancient DNA from Anatolian Neolithic farmers, whose genetic material we obtained by extracting from petrous bones,	yes

Our study underlines a neutral effect of the sternal ZipFix™ system in patients regarding sternal infection. Postoperative complications are similar in both sternal closure methods. The cable-tie-based system is fast, easy to use, reliable and safe.  Wire closure still remains the preferred technique despite reasonable disadvantages. Associated complications, such as infection and sternal instability, cause time- and cost-consuming therapies. We present a new tool for sternal closure with its first clinical experience and results.METHODS: The sternal ZipFix(TM) System is based on the cable-tie principle.

5	56d19ffaab2fed4a47000001	Is there a package in R/bioconductor for classification of alternative splicing?	spliceR: an R package for classification of alternative splicing and prediction of coding potential from RNA-seq data. Recent software improvements in full-length transcript deconvolution prompted us to develop spliceR, an R package for classification of alternative splicing and prediction of coding potential. spliceR uses the full-length transcript output from RNA-seq assemblers to detect single or multiple exon skipping, alternative donor and acceptor sites, intron retention, alternative first or last exon usage, and mutually exclusive exon events. For each of these events spliceR also annotates the genomic coordinates of the differentially spliced elements, facilitating downstream sequence analysis. For each transcript isoform fraction values are calculated to identify transcript switching between conditions. Lastly, spliceR predicts the coding potential, as well as the potential nonsense mediated decay (NMD) sensitivity of each transcript.

Host gene expression in the colon of gnotobiotic interleukin-2-deficient mice colonized with commensal colitogenic or noncolitogenic bacterial strains: common patterns and bacteria strain specific signatures.  Specific pathogen-free (SPF), but not germfree (GF), interleukin (IL)-2-deficient (IL-2-/-) mice develop inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) at 10 to 15 weeks of age. Gnotobiotic IL-2-/- mice monocolonized with E. coli mpk develop IBD at 25 to 33 weeks of age but not B. vulgatus mpk, E. coli Nissle 1917, or mice cocolonized with both E. coli mpk and B. vulgatus Lactobacillus reuteri promotes Helicobacter hepaticus-associated typhlocolitis in gnotobiotic B6.129P2-IL-10(tm1Cgn) (IL-10(-/-) ) mice. To model inflammatory bowel disease, we assessed infection with Helicobacter hepaticus 3B1 (ATCC 51449) and a potential probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri (ATCC PTA-6475) in gnotobiotic B6.129P2-IL-10(tm1Cgn) (IL-10(-/-) ) mice. No typhlocolitis developed in germ-free controls (n=21) or in L. reuteri (n=8) or H. hepaticus (n=18) mono-associated mice for 20 weeks post-infection. As positive controls, three specific pathogen-free IL-10(-/-) mice dosed with H. hepaticus developed severe typhlocolitis within 11 weeks.  These data support that the development of typhlocolitis in H. hepaticus-infected IL-10(-/-) mice required co-colonization with other microbiota and in this study, required only L. reuteri.  When transferred to gnotobiotic mice, gut microbiomes from mice with active disease versus treatment-induced remission elicited varying degrees of colitis.  The role of gut microbiota (commensal bacteria) and the mucosal barrier in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases and cancer: contribution of germ-free and gnotobiotic animal models of human diseases. The immunomodulatory effects of microbiota and probiotics for inflammatory bowel diseases and the role of bacteria in their etiologies are being studied in gnotobiotic systems.

13	5321b8579b2d7acc7e000008	Is there any functional association during viral replication between flaviviridae viral RNA depended RNA polymerase and viral helicase?	Several labs have obtained evidence for a protein complex that involves many of the nonstructural (NS) proteins encoded by the virus. NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B appear to interact structurally and functionally. In this study, we investigated the interaction between the helicase, NS3, and the RNA polymerase, NS5B. Pull-down experiments and surface plasmon resonance data indicate a direct interaction between NS3 and NS5B that is primarily mediated through the protease domain of NS3. This interaction reduces the basal ATPase activity of NS3. However, NS5B stimulates product formation in RNA unwinding experiments under conditions of excess nucleic acid substrate. When the concentrations of NS3 and NS5B are in excess of nucleic acid substrate, NS5B reduces the rate of NS3-catalyzed unwinding. Under pre-steady-state conditions, in which NS3 and substrate concentrations are similar, product formation increased in the presence of NS5B. The increase was consistent with 1:1 complex formed between the two proteins. A fluorescently labeled form of NS3 was used to investigate this interaction through fluorescence polarization binding assays. Results from this assay support interactions that include a 1:1 complex formed between NS3 and NS5B. Contradictory results have been reported regarding NS3 in RNA synthesis. To investigate the effect of NS3 on classical swine fever virus (CSFV) NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (RdRp) activity and NS3-NS5B interaction, RdRp reactions, GST-pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation analyses containing NS5B and either of NS3 protein and the different truncated NS3 mutants were performed, respectively. We found that NS3 stimulated NS5B RdRp activity in a dose-dependent manner by binding to NS5 through a NS3 protease domain. Furthermore, mapping important regions of the NS3 protease domain was carried out by deletion mutagenesis, associated with RdRp reactions, GST-pull-down assays and co-immunoprecipitation analyses. Results showed that stimulation of CSFV NS5B RdRp activity was obtained by NS3 binding to NS5B through a 31-amino acid fragment at the N-terminal end of NS3 protease domain, which mediated a specific NS3-NS5B interaction. The protocols detailed in this unit are used to purify three recombinant enzymes that are widely used in HCV research: the HCV NS3 protease domain, the helicase domain as an NS3+NS4A complex, and the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The active enzymes are purified to homogeneity by two-column chromatography to support a screening program for HCV inhibitors. Among potential targets are viral entry factors, including scavenger receptor type B1 (SR-B1) and CD81, as well as neutralizing antibodies against the viral glycoproteins. Popular targets related to translation and replication are the NS3/4A protease (inhibited by telaprevir and boceprevir) and the NS5B polymerase, as well as the NS2/3 autoprotease, the NS3 helicase, and nonenzymatic targets such as NS4B and NS5A proteins.  The NS3 helicase domain competes with NS3 full-length for NS5 RdRp binding, with a K(d.) of 2.5μM. Since NS3 and NS5 are required for DENV replication, this fascile assay could be used to screen for non-nucleoside, allosteric inhibitors that disrupt the interaction between the two proteins.	yes
21	515d9a42298dcd4e5100000d	Is Propofol used for short-term sedation?	The current study explores the incidence and content of dreaming during short-term sedation with sevoflurane or propofo Propofol is the sedative most frequently used for short-term sedation and the weaning phase, whereas benzodiazepines are the preferred substances for medium- and long-term sedation. Performance of the A-line Autoregressive Index (AAI) and of the Bispectral Index (BIS) at assessing depth of short-term sedation following cardiac surgery. All patients received sedation with propofol according to the study protocol. Short-term sedation with either sevoflurane using ACD or propofol did not negatively affect renal function postoperatively. Assessing feasibility and physiological effects of sedation with sevoflurane, administered with the anesthetic conserving device (AnaConDa), in comparison with propofol and remifentanil. Sevoflurane can be effectively and safely used for short-term sedation of ICU patients with stable hemodynamic conditions. Propofol was used for most of the patients during short-term sedation (57%) and during weaning (48%).

This prospective, clinical trial evaluated the effects of short-term propofol administration on triglyceride levels and serum pancreatic enzymes in children undergoing sedation for magnetic resonance imaging. Dexmedetomidine vs. propofol for short-term sedation of postoperative mechanically ventilated patients. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and endocrine response of propofol vs. the new alpha2-agonist dexmedetomidine for sedation in surgical intensive care patients who need postoperative short-term ventilation. A total of 89 adult, nonemergent, coronary artery bypass graft patients with an expected length of intubation of <24 hrs.

Pharmacokinetics and effects of propofol 6% for short-term sedation in paediatric patients following cardiac surgery. This paper describes the pharmacokinetics and effects of propofol in short-term sedated paediatric patients. Twenty patients who were expected to require 8 h of post-operative sedation and ventilation were allocated randomly to receive either an infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.2-2.5 microg kg(-1) h(-1) or propofol 1-3 mg kg(-1) h(-1) Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propofol 6% SAZN versus propofol 1% SAZN and Diprivan-10 for short-term sedation following coronary artery bypass surgery. The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety characteristics of propofol 6% SAZN were investigated during a short-term infusion and compared with the commercially available product propofol 1% in Intralipid 10% (Diprivan-10) and propofol 1% in Lipofundin MCT/LCT 10% (propofol 1% SAZN). METHODS: In a randomised double-blind study, 24 male patients received a 5-h infusion of propofol at the rate of 1 mg/kg/h for sedation in the immediate postoperative period following coronary artery bypass surgery Propofol infusion and oxycodone-thiopental bolus dosages, titrated to the same sedation end point, resulted in similar time from admission to extubation, although the weaning period was shorter in the propofol group. In terms of breathing pattern, gas exchange, blood gases and haemodynamics, the methods were similar. Propofol, despite its attractive pharmacological profile, may offer no clinical benefit in short-term sedation after a moderate dose fentanyl anaesthesia in cardiac surgery. Postoperative short-term sedation with propofol in cardiac surgery. We conducted a randomized double-blind study to assess the safety and effectiveness of short-term sedation with propofol in adult patients immediately after cardiac surgery. The use of propofol for short-term sedation in ICUs has allowed the maintenance of sedation to continue until just a few hours before extubation but the benefits of propofol for longer-term indications are more debatable. Midazolam and propofol are available as hypnotics for short-term sedation during the post-operative period. The use of midazolam versus propofol for short-term sedation following coronary artery bypass grafting. Midazolam and propofol were compared in an open randomized study for postoperative sedation during 12 h of mechanical ventilation in 40 patients following coronary artery bypass grafting Propofol is a known anesthetic agent, widely used for short-term anesthesia and for longer-term sedation. Propofol was the most commonly used agent overall during the observational period (primarily for short-term and intermediate-length sedation); midazolam was the most commonly used for long-term sedation.	yes
48	58d8d0cc8acda34529000008	Can methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations cause homocystinuria?	Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder.  Several mutations seen in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) give rise to the formation of hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria, a considerable risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders, by leading to enzymatic inactivation. At admission, he had significantly elevated plasma and urine levels of total homocysteine, significantly decreased levels of folate in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and a normal blood concentration of methionine. Response to treatment demonstrated B(6)-non-responsive homocystinuria. Molecular study showed compound heterozygous T353 N and D444 N mutations of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS) gene, and also a C667T homozygous mutation of the methylenetetrahydrofolate-reductase (MTHFR) gene.  Our case is atypical because of the absence of thromboembolism and the mild phenotype, in spite of being B(6)-non-responsive, and the association of a rare compound heterozygous mutation of the CBS gene and also an homozygous mutation of the MTHFR gene. Molecular characterization of five patients with homocystinuria due to severe methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a key regulatory enzyme in folate and homocysteine metabolism. Research performed during the past decade has clarified our understanding of MTHFR deficiencies that cause homocystinuria or mild hyperhomocysteinemia. Our cloning of the MTHFR coding sequence was initially followed by the identification of the first deleterious mutations in MTHFR, in patients with homocystinuria and marked hyperhomocysteinemia. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a key enzyme in the regulation of plasma homocysteine levels. MTHFR deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, results in homocystinuria and hypomethioninaemia and presents with highly variable symptoms affecting many organs but predominantly the central nervous system.  Some methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations cause hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria. Rare mutations in the MTHFR gene have been associated with autosomal recessive MTHFR deficiency leading to homocystinuria. Characterization of six novel mutations in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene in patients with homocystinuria. Five patients suspected of having non-classical homocystinuria due to MTHFR deficiency were examined with respect to their symptoms, MTHFR enzyme activity and genotypes of the MTHFR gene. The results of our study render the full-length characterisation of affected alleles in severe homocystinuria and moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia due to MTHFR deficiency and provide a basis for investigating the regulation of the human MTHFR gene. Our cloning of the MTHFR coding sequence was initially followed by the identification of the first deleterious mutations in MTHFR, in patients with homocystinuria and marked hyperhomocysteinemia. Different MTHFR mutations lead either to severe homocystinuria as a multisystem disorder or to moderate hyperhomocysteinaemia, which is a common risk factor for disorders ranging from cardiovasculopathy to spina bifida. We studied 24 patients with homocystinuria caused by homozygous CBS deficiency from 18 unrelated kindreds for FVL and for the 677C-->T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and investigated their possible interaction in the risk of venous thrombosis. On the contrary, thermolabile MTHFR caused by the 677C-->T mutation, was frequently observed among homocystinuria patients, especially among those with thromboembolic complications: three of six homocystinuria patients who had suffered from a thromboembolic event had thermolabile MTHFR. We studied 24 patients with homocystinuria caused by homozygous CBS deficiency from 18 unrelated kindreds for FVL and for the 677C-->T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and investigated their possible interaction in the risk of venous thrombosis.

AIM: Some methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutations cause hyperhomocysteinemia and homocystinuria.  Betaine for treatment of homocystinuria caused by methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency. Severe deficiency of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) with homocystinuria can result in early demise or later-onset neurological impairment, including developmental delay, motor dysfunction, and seizures.  Deficiency of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) leads to deficient remethylation of homocysteine and is one of the causes of homocystinuria.  Neurological disturbances have been described in homocystinuria caused by severe MTHFR deficiency.  The 677C-->T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene is an important cause of mild hyperhomocysteinemia, but this polymorphism does not seem to be a risk factor for venous thrombosis. Research performed during the past decade has clarified our understanding of MTHFR deficiencies that cause homocystinuria or mild hyperhomocysteinemia. The 677C>T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene is an important cause of mild hyperhomocysteinaemia. The most common genetic cause of hyperhomocysteinemia is the 677C-->T mutation in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene. Our cloning of the MTHFR coding sequence was initially followed by the identification of the first deleterious mutations in MTHFR, in patients with homocystinuria and marked hyperhomocysteinemia.
