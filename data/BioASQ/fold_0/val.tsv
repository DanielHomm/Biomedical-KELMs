15	531a3fe3b166e2b806000038	Is pregnancy an additional risk during during H1N1 infection?	H1N1 influenza in pregnancy can be associated with severe complications This case series confirms a high number of complications in pregnant women due to pandemic H1N1/09. Pregnant women might be at increased risk for complications from pandemic H1N1 virus infection. Pregnant women are at increased risk for complications from pandemic influenza H1N1 virus infection.  Vaccination of pregnant women against influenza A (H1N1) by Russian subunit formulation (MonoGrippol plus) showed reactogenicity comparable to control group by the level of influence on general metabolic and immunologic homeostasis and on the course of pregnancy, which is an evidence of its safety Pregnancy was identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to H1N1 influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010 While it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively if myocarditis was caused by either infection with H1N1 virus or as a result of pregnancy (in the absence of endomyocardial biopsies), the significant association with myocardial involvement in both women demonstrates the increased risk of exposure to H1N1 influenza virus in pregnant women. Although limited in size, the fully prospective nature of the safety follow-up of these women vaccinated during pregnancy is unique and offers an important degree of reassurance for the use of the AS03 adjuvanted H1N1 (2009) vaccine in this high risk group for H1N1 infection. During the H1N1 2009 pandemic, pregnant women constituted one of the priority groups for vaccination in many countries, creating a need for close monitoring of the safety of the vaccine in pregnant women Emerging data suggest that pregnancy conveys high risk for severe complications from the 2009 pandemic influenza A virus (2009 H1N1) infection Pregnant women have been identified as a group at risk, both for respiratory complications than for the admissions to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic This report mitigates substantially the presumed severity of pandemic H1N1/09 influenza infection during pregnancy The results of our study do not indicate a risk for the pregnant woman and the developing embryo/fetus after H1N1 vaccination This large cohort study found no evidence of an increased risk of fetal death associated with exposure to an adjuvanted pandemic A/H1N1 2009 influenza vaccine during pregnancy Our results suggest that second- or third-trimester H1N1 vaccination was associated with improved fetal and neonatal outcomes during the recent pandemic Pregnant women might thus be at increased risk of complications from pandemic H1N1 virus infection, and illness may progress rapidly Pregnant women with H1N1 infection seem to benefit from antiviral therapy. arly identification and treatment were the most important factors in different countries and areas examined. The vaccine and antiviral drugs that have been the most efficient means to control the novel virus appear to be safe but require more extensive study However, there were significant differences between the two groups in relation to mean age, treatment with oseltamivir, schooling, and presence of other risk factors To investigate whether exposure to an adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine during pregnancy was associated with increased risk of adverse fetal outcomes. In this Danish cohort, exposure to an adjuvanted influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccine during pregnancy was not associated with a significantly increased risk of major birth defects, preterm birth, or fetal growth restriction Most people affected by the virus, including pregnant women, suffer a mild viral illness, and make a full recovery Pregnant women, because of their altered immunity and physiological adaptations, are at higher risk of developing pulmonary complications, especially in the second and third trimesters The pregnancy outcomes were also poor for women who were affected by the virus with a fivefold increase in the perinatal mortality rate and threefold increase in the preterm delivery rate regnant women were at increased risk for serious outcomes of 2009 pandemic influenza A virus subtype H1N1 (influenza A[H1N1]pdm09) infection, but little is known about the overall impact of the pandemic on neonatal and maternal outcomes In this large, geographically diverse population, A(H1N1)pdm09 infection increased the risk for hospitalization during pregnancy Vaccination during pregnancy with Pandemrix(®) appeared to have no ill effects on the pregnancy. On the contrary, the rate of preterm birth and low birthweight was lower than expected, which agrees with some previous results During the influenza A(H1N1)pmd09 pandemic, although many cases occurred in younger adults, the risk factors identified for severe infections and complications were similar to those for seasonal influenza, including chronic respiratory, renal, liver, and heart diseases. In terms of pregnancy, the studies have shown contradictory results due to variations in methodology and medical care. However, it seems that pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester, increases the risk of complications, and that early antiviral treatment is associated with improved outcomes. Pregnant women with mild clinical illness secondary to 2009 H1N1 were not at a greater risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes However, severely infected women were more likely to deliver SGA infants Gestational age is associated with the risk of developing critical infection. The risk increases with increasing weeks of gestation.  Following the start of winter in Liaoning province in China, the number of pregnant women infected with influenza increased significantly regnancy, with or without additional complications, constitutes a high-risk condition for complications of influenza infection and warrants early intervention with neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, if influenza is suspected	yes

52	53009f6d2059c6d71c00007e	Is long QT syndrome a cause for sudden cardiac death in athletes?	A diversity of cardiovascular disorders including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital coronary anomalies, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, dilated cardiomyopathy, aortic rupture due to Marfan syndrome, myocarditis, valvular disease and electrical disorders (Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome), as well as commotio cordis represent the common causes of SCD in young athletes. Sudden cardiac death is the leading cause of mortality among young athletes with an incidence of 1-2 per 100,000 athletes per annum. The majority of cases are caused by an underlying structural cardiac abnormality, most commonly hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. More recently, the understanding of non-structural causes such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome has grown and diagnostic criteria have been developed.  This review considers in particular the causes of death affecting athletes below 35 years of age. In this age group the largest proportion of deaths are caused by diseases with autosomal dominant inheritance such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT-syndrome, and Marfan's syndrome.  Knowledge of sudden cardiac death in young athletes is imperative for all physicians and allied health professionals.  In this article, we review several etiologies of sudden cardiac death, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and commotio cordis.  Sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes is generally caused by inherited cardiac disorders. The genetic abnormalities most associated with SCD are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The most common cause of sudden cardiac death in athletes is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Other reasons are congenital coronary artery anomalies, nivocarditis, dilatative cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the right ventricle, sarcoidosis, mitral valve prolapse, aortic valve stenosis, atherosclerosis, long QT syndrome, and blunt impact to the chest. The congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is caused by cardiac ion channel mutations, which predispose young individuals to sudden cardiac death often related to exercise.  A group of relatively uncommon but important genetic cardiovascular diseases (GCVDs) are associated with increased risk for sudden cardiac death during exercise, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, long-QT syndrome, Marfan syndrome, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Primary electrical disorders (such as the long QT syndrome) are rarely present in athletes but, so far, are a considerable reason for disqualification from sport activity. 	yes

69	5144bc8fd24251bc0500000e	Is single-cell analysis (SCA) possible in proteomics?	Toward Single Cell Analysis by Plume Collimation in Laser Ablation Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry. he advent of proteomics and genomics at a single-cell level has set the basis for an outstanding improvement in analytical technology and data acquisition. The new-generation technology of single-cell analysis is able to better characterize a cell's population, identifying and differentiating outlier cells, in order to provide both a single-cell experiment and a corresponding bulk measurement, through the identification, quantification and characterization of all system biology aspects (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, degradomics and fluxomics). The movement of omics into single-cell analysis represents a significant and outstanding shift. Laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI) is a novel method for the direct imaging of biological tissues by mass spectrometry. By performing ionization in the ambient environment, this technique enables in vivo studies with potential for single-cell analysis. Other approaches for MS-based chemical imaging and profiling include those based on near-field laser ablation and inductively-coupled plasma MS analysis, which offer complementary capabilities for subcellular chemical imaging and profiling. Mass spectrometry imaging and profiling of single cells. his is rapidly changing with the recent examples of single cell genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics. The rate of change is expected to accelerate owing to emerging technologies that range from micro/nanofluidics to microfabricated interfaces for mass spectrometry to third- and fourth-generation automated DNA sequencers Single-cell analysis (SCA) has been increasingly recognized as the key technology for the elucidation of cellular functions, which are not accessible from bulk measurements on the population level. Thus far, SCA has been achieved by miniaturization of established engineering concepts to match the dimensions of a single cell Single-cell proteomic chip for profiling intracellular signaling pathways in single tumor cells. The amount of single proteins in single cells can be as low as one copy per cell and is for most proteins in the attomole range or below; usually considered as insufficient for proteomic analysis. n Arabidopsis thaliana, we have successfully identified nine unique proteins in a single-cell sample and 56 proteins from a pool of 15 single-cell samples from glucosinolate-rich S-cells by nanoLC-MS/MS proteomic analysis, thus establishing the proof-of-concept for true single-cell proteomic analysis A first step towards practical single cell proteomics: a microfluidic antibody capture chip with TIRF detection.	no

The RET proto-oncogene is the major gene associated to HSCR with differential contributions of its rare and common, coding and noncoding mutations to the multifactorial nature of this pathology The RET proto-oncogene is the major gene for HSCR with differential contributions of its rare and common, coding and noncoding mutations to the multifactorial nature of this pathology The rearranged during transfection gene (RET) is considered the major gene in HSCR RET is the major gene associated to Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) with differential contributions of its rare and common, coding and noncoding mutations to the multifactorial nature of this pathology While all Mendelian modes of inheritance have been described in syndromic HSCR, isolated HSCR stands as a model for genetic disorders with complex patterns of inheritance. The tyrosine kinase receptor RET is the major gene with both rare coding sequence mutations and/or a frequent variant located in an enhancer element predisposing to the disease  The rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene is the major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease, and germline mutations in RET have been reported in up to 50% of the inherited forms of Hirschsprung disease and in 15-20% of sporadic cases of Hirschsprung disease. The RET proto-oncogene is the major gene involved in the complex genetics of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or aganglionic megacolon, showing causative loss-of-function mutations in 15-30% of the sporadic cases. The major gene for Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) encodes the receptor tyrosine kinase RET. The RET proto-oncogene is considered to be the major susceptibility gene involved in Hirschsprung disease.  Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a developmental disorder characterized by the absence of enteric neurons in distal segments of the gut, shows a complex pattern of inheritance, with the RET protooncogene acting as a major gene and additional susceptibility loci playing minor roles.  Traditional RET germline mutations account for a small subset of Hirschsprung disease patients, but several studies have shown that there is a specific haplotype of RET associated with the sporadic forms of Hirschsprung disease. PURPOSE: The RET proto-oncogene is considered to be the major susceptibility gene involved in Hirschsprung disease. The RET proto-oncogene is the major gene involved in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung (HSCR), a complex genetic disease characterized by lack of ganglia along variable lengths of the gut. While rare variants (RVs) in the coding sequence (CDS) of several genes involved in ENS development lead to disease, the association of common variants (CVs) with HSCR has only been reported for RET (the major HSCR gene) and NRG1. The rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene is the major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease, and germline mutations in RET have been reported in up to 50% of the inherited forms of Hirschsprung disease and in 15-20% of sporadic cases of Hirschsprung disease. The major gene for Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) encodes the receptor tyrosine kinase RET. In a study of 690 European- and 192 Chinese-descent probands and their parents or controls, we demonstrate the ubiquity of a >4-fold susceptibility from a C-->T allele (rs2435357: p = 3.9 x 10(-43) in European ancestry; p = 1.1 x 10(-21) in Chinese samples) that probably arose once within the intronic RET enhancer MCS+9.7. Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), a developmental disorder characterized by the absence of enteric neurons in distal segments of the gut, shows a complex pattern of inheritance, with the RET protooncogene acting as a major gene and additional susceptibility loci playing minor roles. BACKGROUND: The RET gene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in different human neurocristopathies, such as specific neuroendocrine tumours and Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). The first major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease is the RET proto-oncogene on 10q11.2. The developmental abnormalities apparent in these mice, together with the observation that the major tissues affected in MEN 2 and Hirschsprung disease have a common origin in the embryonal neural crest, suggest that RET encodes a receptor for a developmental regulator involved in the genesis of a variety of neural crest derivatives, and in the organogenesis of the kidney. RET is the major gene involved in HSCR. Recent advances show that the RET gene is a major locus involved in the pathogenesis of HSCR. Although with several genes involved in its pathogenesis, the major HSCR gene is the RET proto-oncogene. In this model, a major gene, RET, is involved in most if not all cases of isolated (i.e., nonsyndromic) HSCR, in conjunction with other autosomal susceptibility loci under a multiplicative model. The RET proto-oncogene is the major gene involved in the pathogenesis of Hirschsprung (HSCR), a complex genetic disease characterized by lack of ganglia along variable lengths of the gut The RET proto-oncogene is the major gene involved in the complex genetics of Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), or aganglionic megacolon, showing causative loss-of-function mutations in 15-30% of the sporadic cases The RET proto-oncogene is considered to be the major susceptibility gene involved in Hirschsprung disease Analysis of the RET gene, the major gene involved in HSCR susceptibility, revealed neither linkage nor mutations RET is the major gene involved in HSCR Although with several genes involved in its pathogenesis, the major HSCR gene is the RET proto-oncogene While rare variants (RVs) in the coding sequence (CDS) of several genes involved in ENS development lead to disease, the association of common variants (CVs) with HSCR has only been reported for RET (the major HSCR gene) and NRG1 The rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene is the major susceptibility gene for Hirschsprung disease, and germline mutations in RET have been reported in up to 50% of the inherited forms of Hirschsprung disease and in 15-20% of sporadic cases of Hirschsprung disease Recent advances show that the RET gene is a major locus involved in the pathogenesis of HSCR In this model, a major gene, RET, is involved in most if not all cases of isolated (i.e., nonsyndromic) HSCR, in conjunction with other autosomal susceptibility loci under a multiplicative model We report on mutation analysis of five genes involved in the receptor tyrosine kinase (RET) or the endothelin-signalling pathways in 28 sporadic Japanese patients with Hirschsprung disease In addition to mutations in the RET and EDNRB genes, embryonic environmental factors and/or other genetic factors appear to be involved in the development of Hirschsprung disease The RET gene is the major HSCR gene, although reduced penetrance of RET mutations and variable expression of HSCR phenotype indicates that more than one gene is required	yes

109	514a59c2d24251bc0500005d	Is paroxetine effective for treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder?	To evaluate the cost effectiveness of the four medications with a US FDA-approved indication for PMDD: fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine and drospirenone plus ethinyl estradiol (DRSP/EE). All SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, fluvoxamine, citalopram, and clomipramine) were effective in reducing premenstrual symptoms. Paroxetine has been approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder (PD), generalised anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD) in adults, whereas paroxetine CR is approved for the treatment of MDD, SAD, PD and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in adults. Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been proven safe and effective for the treatment of PMDD and are recommended as first-line agents when pharmacotherapy is warranted. Currently fluoxetine, controlled-release paroxetine, and sertraline are the only Food and Drug Administration-approved agents for this indication. When compared with placebo, patients treated with paroxetine 20 mg attained a significant reduction in irritability (difference in median percent change: -23.9, 95% CI = -51.3 to -6.2, p = .014; difference in mean absolute change: -18.6, 95% CI = -32.5 to -4.6, p = .007). A statistically significant difference was not observed when the patients treated with the lower dose of paroxetine (10 mg) were compared with placebo. Treatment was well tolerated with no unexpected side effects. Intermittent administration of paroxetine 20 mg significantly reduced irritability symptoms in patients with PMDD. All these women had significant improvements in the HAMA, HAMD, CGI, and PRISM calendar. The rate of response to paroxetine treatment lay between 50% and 78.6% in the continuous-treatment group, and 37.5-93.8% in the intermittent-treatment group, as determined at the study end-point. The present results indicate that paroxetine is effective in both continuous and intermittent treatment of oriental PMDD women, and that the effects of active treatment lasted for six consecutive treatment menstrual cycles. Paroxetine CR is approved for the treatment of major depression, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and premenstrual dysphoric disorder in adults. Continuous treatment with paroxetine reduced premenstrual symptoms effectively with a response rate of 85%. Intermittent treatment was as effective as continuous treatment in reducing irritability, affect lability, and mood swings, but had a somewhat weaker effect on depressed mood and somatic symptoms. Daily Record of Severity of Problems scores were lower in the paroxetine group compared with the placebo group, although the differences were not statistically significant. However, the mean on-treatment Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (clinician-rated) score for the paroxetine group was 17.9 +/- 8.3 compared with 31.5 +/- 11.2 in the placebo group (adjusted mean difference = 13.6, P = 0.009). Response (Clinical Global Impressions Scale score of 1 or 2) occurred in 70% of subjects randomized to paroxetine CR and 10% of those assigned to placebo (chi2(1) = 7.5, P = 0.006). The US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada recently approved paroxetine for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Patients treated with either dose of paroxetine CR demonstrated significantly greater improvements on the primary efficacy measure (change from baseline in mean luteal phase VAS-Mood scores) and on the majority of secondary efficacy measures compared with patients randomly assigned to placebo. For the treatment of PMDD, luteal phase dosing with 12.5 mg and 25 mg of paroxetine CR is effective and generally well tolerated. A statistically significant difference was observed in favor of paroxetine CR 25 mg versus placebo on the VAS-Mood (adjusted mean difference = -12.58 mm, 95% CI = -18.40 to -6.76; p < .001) and for paroxetine CR 12.5 mg versus placebo (adjusted mean difference = -7.51 mm, 95% CI = -13.40 to -1.62; p = .013). Paroxetine CR doses of 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day are effective in treating PMDD and are well tolerated. At end point, subjects treated with paroxetine CR (12.5 mg and 25 mg) demonstrated significant improvement in VAS-Mood scores compared with those who received placebo (paroxetine CR 12.5 mg mean treatment difference vs. placebo, -8.7 mm; 95% CI, -15.7, -1.7; p =.015; paroxetine CR 25 mg mean treatment difference vs. placebo, -12.1 mm; 95% CI, -18.9, -5.3; p <.001). Both doses of paroxetine CR 12.5 mg and 25 mg daily are effective and well tolerated in patients who suffer from PMDD. Of these agents, sertraline, fluoxetine and paroxetine (as an extended-release formulation) are approved by the US FDA for luteal phase, as well as continuous, administration. In well designed placebo-controlled trials in patients with major depressive disorder (including a study in the elderly), social anxiety disorder or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), paroxetine CR was consistently superior to placebo with regards to primary endpoints (i.e. mean Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score [major depressive disorder], Liebowitz social anxiety scale total score and Clinical Global Impressions-Global Improvement score [social anxiety disorder] and Visual Analogue Scale-Mood score [PMDD]). Paroxetine is a potent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with indications for the treatment of depression, obsessive- compulsive disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. It is also used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache. Studies having compared the efficiency of antidepressants according to their serotonin activity (paroxetine or sertraline versus maprotiline, that is a selective noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor), showed that serotonin re-uptake inhibitors were significantly more efficient on all symptoms than maprotiline, that was not more efficient than placebo. Paroxetine is a potent and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with currently approved indications for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. It is also used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache. Preliminary data suggest that paroxetine has potential in the treatment of social phobia, premenstrual dysphoric disorder and chronic headache. The effects of active treatment were marked by the first active cycle with luteal phase 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores decreasing from 14.9 (+/- 5.3) to 8.2 (+/- 4.9) in the first, 7.8 (+/- 5.1) in the second, and 7.8 (+/- 6.8) in the third active treatment cycles (F[1,13] = 17.6; p < 0.0001). The most conservative measure, the Clinical Global Impression (CGI), revealed that 7 of 14 patients had a complete response (CGI = 1 or 2) whereas 4 patients had a partial response (CGI = 3). These open trial findings are consistent with the notion that paroxetine is effective in the acute phase for the treatment of PDD. The rating of premenstrual irritability, depressed mood, increase in appetite, and anxiety/tension was markedly lower during treatment with paroxetine than before, and this reduction in symptomatology appeared unabated for the entire treatment period.	yes
114	56c1d85cef6e394741000034	Is there evidence that tomato juice lowers cholesterol levels?	The hypocholesterolemic effect of tomato juice has been investigated in an intervention study with rats, along with the possible inhibition effect of bioactive tomato compounds binding to the HMGCR enzyme. The molecular modelling showed that components of tomato can bind to the active site of the enzyme and compete with the ligand HMGCoA. Lycopene, from tomato juice, accumulates in the liver and can inhibit the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, HMGCR.  Juice consumption significantly improved resistance of LDL+VLDL-C to Cu(2+)-mediated oxidation (P = 0.039), HDL-C (47.3 ± 15.8 to 51.7 ± 14.8 mg/dL, P<0.001), and the ratio of total-C/HDL-C (4.25 ± 1.59 to 3.63 ± 1.16, P<0.001) at 8 wk. RESULTS: Intervention with the enriched juice had no effect on the lipid profile, and serum levels of triglycerides and cholesterol (total, LDL, and HDL) remained unchanged.  Women consuming ≥10 compared with<1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had significant but clinically modest improvements in total cholesterol (TC) (5.38 vs. 5.51 mmol/L; P = 0.029), the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio (4.08 vs. 4.22; P = 0.046), and hemoglobin A1c (5.02 vs. 5.13%; P<0.001) in multivariable models. Considering clinical cutpoints, women consuming ≥10 compared with<1.5 servings/wk were 31% (95% CI = 6%, 50%), 40% (95% CI = 13%, 59%), and 66% (95% CI = 20%, 86%) less likely to have elevated TC (≥6.21 mmol/L), LDL cholesterol (≥4.14 mmol/L), and hemoglobin A1c (≥6%), respectively.  In conclusion, women consuming ≥10 compared with<1.5 servings/wk of tomato-based food products had clinically modest but significant improvements in TC, the TC:HDL cholesterol ratio, and hemoglobin A1c but not other coronary biomarkers. Tomato juice decreases LDL cholesterol levels and increases LDL resistance to oxidation. Total cholesterol concentration was reduced by 5.9 (sd 10) % (P = 0.002) and LDL cholesterol concentration by 12.9 (sd 17.0) % (P = 0.0002) with the high tomato diet compared to the low tomato diet. In conclusion, a high dietary intake of tomato products had atheroprotective effects, it significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels, and increased LDL resistance to oxidation in healthy normocholesterolaemic adults. Total, LDL and HDL cholesterol were significantly lower in the intervention group after the intake of tomato juice Total cholesterol concentration was reduced by 5.9 (sd 10) % (P = 0.002) and LDL cholesterol concentration by 12.9 (sd 17.0) % (P = 0.0002) with the high tomato diet compared to the low tomato diet. 	yes
116	56d2ee61f22319765a000007	Are messenger RNA molecules epigenetically methylated?	The most abundant mRNA post-transcriptional modification is N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), which has broad roles in RNA biology. N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modified base in eukaryotic mRNA and has been linked to diverse effects on mRNA fate.  Recently, methylation patterns have also been revealed in mRNA. Surprisingly, the two most commonly studied methylation states in mRNA (m6A and m5C) are found to be enriched in 3'-UTRs (untranslated regions), the target site for the majority of miRNAs. MeT-DB: a database of transcriptome methylation in mammalian cells Methyltranscriptome is an exciting new area that studies the mechanisms and functions of methylation in transcripts. The MethylTranscriptome DataBase (MeT-DB, http://compgenomics.utsa.edu/methylation/) is the first comprehensive resource for N6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in mammalian transcriptome. Mammalian messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) contain tens of thousands of posttranscriptional chemical modifications. Among these, the N(6)-methyl-adenosine (m(6)A) modification is the most abundant and can be removed by specific mammalian enzymes. Recent discoveries of reversible N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) methylation on messenger RNA (mRNA) and mapping of m(6)A methylomes in mammals and yeast have revealed potential regulatory functions of this RNA modification. There are several identified methylation modifications in eukaryotic messenger RNA (mRNA), such as N(7)-methylguanosine (m(7)G) at the cap, N(6)-methyl-2'-O-methyladenosine (m(6)Am), 2'-O-methylation (Nm) within the cap and the internal positions, and internal N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) and 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C).	yes
145	52f8a7eb2059c6d71c000052	Is there an association between bruxism and reflux	Rhythmic masticatory muscle activity, including sleep bruxism (SB), can be induced in healthy individuals by experimental esophageal acidification, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, no robust evidence supports the association between SB and GERD. Sleep bruxism is prevalent in GERD patients, and GERD is highly associated with SB. Our large-scale cross-sectional study found that problem behaviors in adolescents were associated with sleep problems, including sleep bruxism, as well as lifestyle and food habits and GERD symptoms. The frequencies of EMG bursts, rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) episodes, grinding noise, and the RMMA/microarousal ratio were significantly higher in the 20-minute period after acidic infusion than after saline infusion. RMMA episodes including SB were induced by esophageal acidification.

Development of human embryonic stem cell therapies for age-related macular degeneration In this review, we describe recent approaches to develop cell-based therapies for the treatment of AMD. Recent research has focused on replacing the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a monolayer of cells vital to photoreceptor cell health. We discuss the various methods used to differentiate and purify RPE from human embryonic stem cells (HESC), and describe the surgical approaches being used to transplant these cells in existing and forthcoming clinical trials. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is characterized by the loss or dysfunction of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and is the most common cause of vision loss among the elderly. Stem-cell-based strategies, using human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), may provide an abundant donor source for generating RPE cells in cell replacement therapies. This study contributes to our understanding of the utility of hESC/hiPSC-derived RPE in AMD therapy. Two important early potential hESC applications are the use of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) for the treatment of age-related macular degeneration and Stargardt disease, an untreatable form of macular dystrophy that leads to early-onset blindness. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are a promising source of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells: cells that can be used for the treatment of common and incurable forms of blindness, such as age-related macular degeneration. A potential application of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is the generation of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) to treat age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a common but incurable retinal disease.

213	52d7b45e98d0239505000002	is pharmacological treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism effective in reducing cardiovascular events?	The decision to treat elderly people is still an unresolved clinical challenge--first, due to a lack of appropriately powered randomized controlled trials of L-T4 in sHT patients, examining cardiovascular hard endpoints in various classes of age; and second, because of the negative effects of possible overtreatment. The lack of specific randomized trials enrolling either old or very old subjects, aimed at evaluate the efficacy of hormonal replacement on overall survival and cardiovascular risk reduction along with the negative effects of possible over-treatment, makes the decision to treat older people a still unresolved clinical challenge In patients with type 2 DM, the presence of SH serves as an additional risk factor for endothelial dysfunction. Treatment of SCH with levothyroxine was associated with fewer IHD events in younger individuals, but this was not evident in older people. Subclinical hyperthyroidism seems to be a risk factor of developing major cardiovascular events, especially stroke in older adults from the general population with normal left ventricular function. SCH appears to influence the postoperative outcome for patients by increasing the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation. However, it is still unproven whether preoperative thyroxine replacement therapy for patients with SCH might prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation after CABG. In CHF patients TSH levels even slightly above normal range are independently associated with a greater likelihood of heart failure progression. In current RCTs, levothyroxine replacement therapy for subclinical hypothyroidism did not result in improved survival or decreased cardiovascular morbidity. Data on health-related quality of life and symptoms did not demonstrate significant differences between intervention groups. However, the actual effectiveness of thyroid hormone substitution in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events remains to be elucidated. In conclusion, the multiplicity and the possible reversibility of subclinical hypothyroidism-associated cardiovascular abnormalities suggest that the decision to treat a patient should depend on the presence of risk factors, rather than on a TSH threshold.  However, whether SH confers a high risk for cardiovascular disease, and whether LT4 therapy has a long-term benefit that clearly outweighs the risks of overzealous treatment in these individuals, remain topics of controversy.	no
214	52e8e96698d023950500001f	Could Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) cause sudden cardiac death?	"Two siblings died suddenly at the ages of 9 and 10 years Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a type of cardiac arrhythmia that occurs in people with a structurally normal heart. Stress or anxiety-induced release of endogenous catecholamines causes a dysfunction in the myocytic calcium-ion channel, leading to ventricular arrhythmias that can cause dizziness, syncope, or sudden cardiac death.  During a follow-up of 48±94 months, arrhythmia events (sudden cardiac death and aborted cardiac arrest) associated with noncompliance occurred in 2 patients.  We report a family with repeat events of sudden cardiac death and recurrent ventricular fibrillation in a teenage girl, where autopsy data and clinical investigations were inconclusive. The diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) was established only following finding a gene mutation in the cardiac ryanodine receptor.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a devastating inherited disorder characterized by episodic syncope and/or sudden cardiac arrest during exercise or acute emotion in individuals without structural cardiac abnormalities. Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals.  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS), leave no evidence to be found at autopsy a spectrum of sudden cardiac death (SCD)-predisposing heritable cardiac arrhythmia syndromes, including long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).  CPVT is a familial arrhythmogenic syndrome characterized by abnormal calcium (Ca(2+)) handling, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death Mutations in RyR2 are linked to catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and sudden cardiac death. Patients with CPVT often present with exercise- or emotion induced syncope, the first presentation can also be sudden cardiac death. Among the five major arrhythmogenic disorders occurring in the absence of a structural heart disease is catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), which is a highly lethal form of inherited arrhythmias.  Patients with CPVT are at high risk of developing life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias when untreated.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome characterized by VT induced by adrenergic stress in the absence of structural heart disease and high incidence of sudden cardiac death.  CPVT is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome caused by gene mutations that destabilize cardiac ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release channels. Sudden cardiac death is incompletely prevented by conventional drug therapy with β-blockers with or without Ca(2+) channel blockers.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease that can cause sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Important potential causes of sudden cardiac deaths in the absence of heart disease are primary electrical diseases such as Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias.  catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS) are primary inherited arrhythmia syndromes that may cause syncope and sudden cardiac death in young individuals.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a cardiac channelopathy characterized by altered intracellular calcium handling resulting in ventricular arrhythmias and high risk of cardiac sudden death in young cases with normal structural hearts.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disorder that causes syncopal episodes related with stress or emotion and even sudden cardiac deaths. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia caused by mutations in the RyR2 gene manifests as severe arrhythmias, and may provide a candidate for sudden cardiac deaths. Patients diagnosed with an electrical cardiomyopathy have an increased risk of syncope and sudden cardiac death (SCD).  Patients with CPVT present with exercise-induced syncope and sudden cardiac death but normal resting electrocardiograms.  Over 80% of SCD occurs in patients with organic heart disease. However, approximately 10-15% of SCD occurs in the presence of structurally normal heart and the majority of those patients are young. In this group of patients, changes in genes encoding cardiac ion channels produce modification of the function of the channel resulting in an electrophysiological substrate of VA and SCD. Collectively these disorders are referred to as Cardiac Ion Channelopathies. The 4 major syndromes in this group are: The Long QT Syndrome (LQTS), the Brugada Syndrome (BrS), the Short QT Syndrome (SQTS), and the Catecholaminergic Polymorphic VT (CPVT).  Important potential causes of sudden cardiac deaths in the absence of heart disease are primary electrical diseases such as Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmias (CPVT).  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that is related to RYR2 or CASQ2 gene mutation. It occurs in patients with structurally normal heart and causes exercise-emotion-triggered syncope and sudden cardiac death. Potentially lethal ion channel disorders (channelopathies) such as the long QT syndromes (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) Aberrant spontaneous, diastolic Ca2+ leak from the SR due to dysfunctional RyR2 contributes to the formation of delayed after-depolarisations, which are thought to underlie the fatal arrhythmia that occurs in both heart failure (HF) and in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an uncommon heritable disease presenting with syncope or sudden cardiac death. Mutations in RyR2 have been linked to exercise-induced sudden cardiac death (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [CPVT]). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a heritable arrhythmia unmasked by exertion or stress, characterized by triggered activity and sudden cardiac death in affected patients. families that exhibit CPVT (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia), a condition in which physical or emotional stress can trigger severe tachyarrhythmias that can lead to sudden cardiac death. that often leads to sudden death in HF and in CPVT. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited disease characterized by adrenergically mediated polymorphic ventricular tachycardia leading to syncope and sudden cardiac death. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by adrenergic induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardias and associated with sudden cardiac death.  These data suggest that ""leaky"" RyR2 channels can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias, providing a possible explanation for CPVT. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare arrhythmogenic disorder characterized by syncopal events and sudden cardiac death at a young age during physical stress or emotion, in the absence of structural heart disease.   catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) account for a relevant proportion of sudden cardiac death cases in young patients cohorts.  has recently been shown to be involved in at least two forms of sudden cardiac death (SCD): (1) Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) "	yes
226	5516fc8832767d0305000002	Is Dicer part of the RISC loading complex?	Dicer is a component of the protein machinery (the RNA Induced Silencing Complex [RISC]) which is involved in catalyzing the formation of mature microRNAs from their precursors in the process of microRNA biogenesis. RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) Proteins PACT, TRBP, and Dicer are SRA binding nuclear receptor coregulators. The cytoplasmic RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) contains dsRNA binding proteins, including protein kinase RNA activator (PACT), transactivation response RNA binding protein (TRBP), and Dicer, that process pre-microRNAs into mature microRNAs (miRNAs) that target specific mRNA species for regulation.   Although the major RNAi pathway proteins are found in most subcellular compartments, the miRNA- and siRNA-loaded Ago2 populations co-sediment almost exclusively with the rER membranes, together with the RISC loading complex (RLC) factors Dicer, TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) and protein activator of the interferon-induced protein kinase (PACT). RNA interference (RNAi) is mediated by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are liberated from double-stranded (ds)RNA precursors by Dicer and guide the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to targets. . Dicer, an RNase III enzyme, plays a central role in the RNAi pathway by cleaving precursors of both of these classes of RNAs to form mature siRNAs and miRNAs, which are then loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).  Canonical siRNAs are 21 nucleotides (nt) in length and are loaded to the RNA Induced Silencing Complex when introduced into the cells, while longer siRNA molecules are first processed by endogenous Dicer and thus termed Dicer-substrate siRNA (DsiRNA). 	yes

However, STAT3 mutants that fail to interact with EIF2AK2 are unable to suppress autophagy Both STAT3-targeting agents (i.e., Stattic, JSI-124 and WP1066) and EIF2AK2 activators (such as the double-strand RNA mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) are capable of disrupting the inhibitory interaction between STAT3 and EIF2AK2 in cellula A further screen designed to identify EIF2AK2-dependent autophagy inducers revealed that several fatty acids including palmitate trigger autophagy via a pathway that involves the disruption of the STAT3-EIF2AK2 complex These results reveal an unsuspected crosstalk between cellular metabolism (fatty acids), pro-inflammatory signaling (STAT3), innate immunity (EIF2AK2), and translational control (EIF2S1) that regulates autophagy Cytoplasmic STAT3 represses autophagy by inhibiting PKR activity The SH2 domain of STAT3 was found to interact with the catalytic domain of the eIF2α kinase 2 EIF2AK2, best known as protein kinase R (PKR). Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulated the activating phosphorylation of PKR and consequent eIF2α hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, PKR depletion inhibited autophagy as initiated by chemical STAT3 inhibitors or free fatty acids like palmitate STAT3-targeting chemicals and palmitate caused the disruption of inhibitory STAT3-PKR interactions, followed by PKR-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation, which facilitates autophagy induction Indeed, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulates EIF2AK2-dependent EIF2S1 phosphorylation and autophagy. A further screen designed to identify EIF2AK2-dependent autophagy inducers revealed that several fatty acids including palmitate trigger autophagy via a pathway that involves the disruption of the STAT3-EIF2AK2 complex as well as the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 8/c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (MAPK8/JNK1) and EIF2S1.

Indeed, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of STAT3 stimulates EIF2AK2-dependent EIF2S1 phosphorylation and autophagy.  Direct interaction between STAT3 and EIF2AK2 controls fatty acid-induced autophagy.

Both STAT3-targeting agents (i.e., Stattic, JSI-124 and WP1066) and EIF2AK2 activators (such as the double-strand RNA mimetic polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid) are capable of disrupting the inhibitory interaction between STAT3 and EIF2AK2 in cellula, yet only the latter does so in cell-free systems in vitro.

258	56f1547c2ac5ed1459000010	Has single guide RNA been used on human cells?	We used a library containing 73,000 sgRNAs to generate knockout collections and performed screens in two human cell lines. Here we engineer this system to enable RNA-guided genome regulation in human cells by tethering transcriptional activation domains either directly to a nuclease-null Cas9 protein or to an aptamer-modified single guide RNA (sgRNA). The type II CRISPR/Cas system from Streptococcus pyogenes and its simplified derivative, the Cas9/single guide RNA (sgRNA) system, have emerged as potent new tools for targeted gene knockout in bacteria, yeast, fruit fly, zebrafish and human cells. Here we engineer this system to enable RNA-guided genome regulation in human cells by tethering transcriptional activation domains either directly to a nuclease-null Cas9 protein or to an aptamer-modified single guide RNA (sgRNA).  Using synthetic single RNA guides, Cas9 can be reprogrammed to create specific double-stranded DNA breaks in the genomes of a variety of organisms, ranging from human cells to bacteria, and thus constitutes a powerful tool for genetic engineering.

260	56bb69d0ac7ad1001900000c	Is amoxicillin used for treatment of malnutrition in children?	 Another RCT did not show superiority of ceftriaxone over amoxicilllin for these same outcomes, but adressed SAM children with and without complications (p = 0.27). Another RCT showed no difference between amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole efficacies for pneumonia in underweight, but not SAM. Our meta-analysis of 12 pooled susceptibility-studies for all types of bacterial isolates, including 2767 stricly SAM children, favoured amoxicillin over cotrimoxazole for susceptibility medians: 42% (IQR 27-55%) vs 22% (IQR 17-23%) and population-weighted-means 52.9% (range 23-57%) vs 35.4% (range 6.7-42%).  Susceptibility-studies favour amoxicillin over cotrimoxazole.  Oral amoxicillin for 5 days was as effective as intramuscular ceftriaxone for 2 days (1 RCT). For uncomplicated SAM, amoxicillin showed no benefit over placebo (1 retrospective study).  Children who took amoxicillin and de-worming had 95% (HR = 1.95, 95%-CI = 1.17, 3.23) and 74% (HR = 1.74, 95%-CI = 1.07, 2.83) more probability to recover from SAM as compared to those who didn't take them. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned Malawian children, 6 to 59 months of age, with severe acute malnutrition to receive amoxicillin, cefdinir, or placebo for 7 days in addition to ready-to-use therapeutic food for the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition.  In the amoxicillin, cefdinir, and placebo groups, 88.7%, 90.9%, and 85.1% of the children recovered, respectively (relative risk of treatment failure with placebo vs. amoxicillin, 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.68; relative risk with placebo vs. cefdinir, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.27 to 2.11). The mortality rates for the three groups were 4.8%, 4.1%, and 7.4%, respectively (relative risk of death with placebo vs. amoxicillin, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.24; relative risk with placebo vs. cefdinir, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.64). Evaluation of the routine use of amoxicillin as part of the home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the inclusion of amoxicillin correlates with better recovery rates in the home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition with ready-to-use therapeutic food. The standard protocol group received a 7-day course of amoxicillin at the onset of treatment. RESULTS: Four hundred and ninety-eight children were treated according to the standard protocol with amoxicillin, and 1955 were treated under the alternate protocol without antibiotics.  The recovery rate for children who received amoxicillin was worse at 4 weeks (40%vs. 71%) but similar after up to 12 weeks of therapy (84%vs. 86%), compared to the children treated without antibiotics. CONCLUSIONS: This review of two therapeutic feeding programmes suggests that children with severe acute malnutrition who were treated without amoxicillin did not have an inferior rate of recovery.

Evaluation of the routine use of amoxicillin as part of the home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the inclusion of amoxicillin correlates with better recovery rates in the home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition with ready-to-use therapeutic food. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared data from the treatment of two groups of children in Malawi aged 6-59 months with uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition.  The recovery rate for children who received amoxicillin was worse at 4 weeks (40%vs. 71%) but similar after up to 12 weeks of therapy (84%vs. 86%), compared to the children treated without antibiotics. Regression modelling indicated that this difference at 4 weeks was most strongly associated with the receipt of amoxicillin. CONCLUSIONS: This review of two therapeutic feeding programmes suggests that children with severe acute malnutrition who were treated without amoxicillin did not have an inferior rate of recovery.

271	56ed08062ac5ed1459000005	Can RG7112 inhibit MDM2?	To assess the influence of the p53 regulatory pathway further, we studied the effect of RG7112, a small molecule MDM2 antagonist that activates p53 by preventing its interaction with MDM2, on normal megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production. RG7112 (2g) is the first clinical small-molecule MDM2 inhibitor designed to occupy the p53-binding pocket of MDM2. Effect of the MDM2 antagonist RG7112 on the P53 pathway in patients with MDM2-amplified, well-differentiated or dedifferentiated liposarcoma: an exploratory proof-of-mechanism study. We report a proof-of-mechanism study of RG7112, a small-molecule MDM2 antagonist, in patients with chemotherapy-naive primary or relapsed well-differentiated or dedifferentiated MDM2-amplified liposarcoma who were eligible for resection. To assess the influence of the p53 regulatory pathway further, we studied the effect of RG7112, a small molecule MDM2 antagonist that activates p53 by preventing its interaction with MDM2, on normal megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production. Discovery of RG7112: A Small-Molecule MDM2 Inhibitor in Clinical Development. RG7112 was the first small-molecule p53-MDM2 inhibitor in clinical development. RG7112 binds MDM2 with high affinity (K(D) ~ 11 nmol/L), blocking its interactions with p53 in vitro. RG7112 is a selective inhibitor of p53-MDM2 binding that frees p53 from negative control, activating the p53 pathway in cancer cells leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The effects of RG7112 and Peg-IFNα 2a on MPN progenitor cells were dependent on blocking p53-MDM2 interactions and activating the p53 pathway, thereby increasing MPN CD34(+) cell apoptosis The orally bioavailable MDM2 antagonist RG7112 and pegylated interferon α 2a target JAK2V617F-positive progenitor and stem cells Initial testing of the MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program In this issue of Blood, Lu et al describe the cooperation between an orally bioavailable mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) antagonist (RG7112) and the pegylated interferon α (Peg-IFNα 2a) to target JAK2V617F hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells MDM2 small-molecule antagonist RG7112 activates p53 signaling and regresses human tumors in preclinical cancer models. Activation of p53 by the MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 impairs thrombopoiesis. The orally bioavailable MDM2 antagonist RG7112 and pegylated interferon α 2a target JAK2V617F-positive progenitor and stem cells. Initial testing of the MDM2 inhibitor RG7112 by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program. The primary endpoint was to assess markers of RG7112-dependent MDM2 inhibition and P53 pathway activation (P53, P21, MDM2, Ki-67, macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 [MIC-1], and apoptosis).  RG7112 is a selective inhibitor of p53-MDM2 binding that frees p53 from negative control, activating the p53 pathway in cancer cells leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. RG7112 was selected for evaluation by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) due to the relatively low incidence of p53 mutations in pediatric cancers compared with adult malignancies. However, the hydrophobic protein-protein interaction surface represents a significant challenge for the development of small-molecule inhibitors with desirable pharmacological profiles. RG7112 was the first small-molecule p53-MDM2 inhibitor in clinical development. Treatment with low doses of RG7112, an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of p53-MDM2, both alone and combined with pegylated interferon α 2a (Peg-IFNα 2a), significantly decreased MPN colony-forming unit-granulocyte macrophage and burst-forming unit-erythroid numbers and preferentially eliminated the total number of JAKV617F(+) MPN hematopoietic progenitor cells. The effects of RG7112 and Peg-IFNα 2a on MPN progenitor cells were dependent on blocking p53-MDM2 interactions and activating the p53 pathway, thereby increasing MPN CD34(+) cell apoptosis. RG7112 (2g) is the first clinical small-molecule MDM2 inhibitor designed to occupy the p53-binding pocket of MDM2. In cancer cells expressing wild-type p53, RG7112 stabilizes p53 and activates the p53 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition or regression of human tumor xenografts.	yes
272	532f08dcd6d3ac6a3400002a	Are there any specific antidotes for dabigatran?	"Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs)--apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban--have a significantly smaller risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, two facts make this situation complicated: First, the risk of hematoma expansion is unknown for NOACs. Second, there is no specific antidote for neither of the NOACs.  However, many physicians are wary of these drugs, since there is limited evidence on how to manage bleeding in patients taking them, and since no specific antidote is known to reverse their anticoagulant effect. Given the absence of a specific antidote, the action to be taken in these situations must be defined.  The fact that there is no specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulant action of the new anticoagulants can impair management of hemorrhagic complications; Unlike the vitamin K antagonist, i.e. warfarin, there is no specific antidote for these medications.  The lack of guidelines, protocols, and an established specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran potentially increases the rates of morbidity and mortality in patients with closed head injury (CHI). The novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) dabigatran etexilat (Pradaxa®), rivaroxaban (Xarelto®) and apixaban (Eliquis®), also known as ""direct"" anticoagulants, act independently from antithrombin by inhibiting thrombin, as in the case of dabigatran, or by inhibiting factor Xa, as in the case of rivaroxaban and apixaban. It is assumed that they are suitable for long-term use and do not require laboratory monitoring. Nevertheless, clinical experience is very limited and caution rather than quick conclusions is necessary. Two major drawbacks are on the one hand the risk of drug accumulation in kidney and/or liver disease and, on the other hand, the lack of specific antidotes.  NOA also have other unresolved problems: drug interactions are still possible, specific coagulation test to assess them must be developed, and no specific antidote is currently available in case of hemorrhagic complication.  It is critical to identify and subsequently manage dabigatran etexilate toxicity because there is no specific antidote to reverse the drug's anticoagulant effects. In the absence of a specific antidote for this novel oral anticoagulant medication, even in an emergency situation, successful surgical treatment was possible with an aggressive use of available prohaemostatic agents. While these trial data are extremely encouraging, several practical issues (e.g., lack of specific antidote, safety of long-term treatment or cost-effectiveness in ""real-life"" clinical practice) still need to be elucidated. In case of massive bleeding, management is unclear and none of these newer agents has a specific antidote that completely reverses its anticoagulant effect. The short half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote in many instances.  As there is no specific antidote, the only treatment option is discontinuation of the drug and supportive management. Currently, none of these new agents has a specific antidote, and little advise can be given on how to manage a major bleeding event. Although there is no specific antidote to antagonise the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran, due to its short duration of effect drug discontinuation is usually sufficient to reverse any excessive anticoagulant activity.

280	53177803b166e2b80600000e	Is there evidence for somatic mosaicism in Tuberous Sclerosis?	There are several case reports of solitary SEGA without any other manifestations of TSC. Usually these cases are thought to be forme fruste of TSC due to somatic mosaicism. Female germline mosaicism in tuberous sclerosis confirmed by molecular genetic analysis This is the first case of germline mosaicism in tuberous sclerosis proven by molecular genetic analysis and also the first example of female germline mosaicism for a characterized autosomal dominant gene mutation apparently not associated with somatic mosaicism. Mutation screening by RT-PCR and direct sequencing of the TSC2 gene identified a 4 bp insertion TACT following nucleotide 2077 in exon 18 which was present in the three affected children but not in five unaffected siblings or the parents. This mutation would cause a frameshift and premature termination at codon 703. Absence of the mutation in lymphocyte DNA from the parents was consistent with germline mosaicism and this was confirmed by our finding of identical chromosome 16 haplotypes in affected and unaffected siblings, providing unequivocal evidence of two different cell lines in the gametes. Molecular analysis of the TSC2 alleles present in the affected subjects showed that the mutation had been inherited from the mother.	yes
297	5713968e1174fb175500000d	Could bioprinting be used in regenerative medicine against bone disease?	Before 3D Printing can be used routinely for the regeneration of complex tissues (e.g. bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels, nerves in the craniomaxillofacial complex), and complex organs with intricate 3D microarchitecture (e.g. liver, lymphoid organs), several technological limitations must be addressed.

305	54d63d873706e89528000006	Is there any association of the chromosomal region harboring the gene ITIH3 with schizophrenia?	The most widely shared subset of genes-common to five of six disorders-included ANK3, AS3MT, CACNA1C, CACNB2, CNNM2, CSMD1, DPCR1, ITIH3, NT5C2, PPP1R11, SYNE1, TCF4, TENM4, TRIM26, and ZNRD1.  Genome-wide significant associations in schizophrenia to ITIH3/4, CACNA1C and SDCCAG8, and extensive replication of associations reported by the Schizophrenia PGC. After combining the new schizophrenia data with those of the PGC, variants at three loci (ITIH3/4, CACNA1C and SDCCAG8) that had not previously been GWS in schizophrenia attained that level of support. In a joint analysis with a bipolar disorder sample (16,374 affected individuals and 14,044 controls), three loci reached genome-wide significance: CACNA1C (rs4765905, P = 7.0 × 10(-9)), ANK3 (rs10994359, P = 2.5 × 10(-8)) and the ITIH3-ITIH4 region (rs2239547, P = 7.8 × 10(-9)). Finally, a combined GWAS analysis of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder yielded strong association evidence for SNPs in CACNA1C and in the region of NEK4-ITIH1-ITIH3-ITIH4.  A recent genome-wide analysis indicated that a polymorphism (rs2535629) of ITIH3 showed the strongest association signal with susceptibility to psychiatric disorders in Caucasian populations. We detected a novel association between suicide attempt and the ITIH3/4-region in a combined group of patients with BD, SCZ and related psychosis spectrum disorders.  These include variations in chromosomal structure at 16p11.2, rare de novo point mutations at the gene SCN2A, and common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mapping near loci encoding the genes ITIH3, AS3MT, CACNA1C and CACNB2. These selected examples point to the challenges to current diagnostic approaches.  STAB1 is located in close proximity to PBMR1 and the NEK4-ITIH1-ITIH3-ITIH4 region, which are the top findings from GWAS meta-analyses of mood disorder, and a combined BD and schizophrenia data set. Our findings suggest that rs2535629 influences the susceptibility to psychiatric disorders by affecting the expression level of GLT8D1.	yes
310	5319a7b2b166e2b806000028	Is there any cross-talk between the Wnt and the Akt pathways?	Our data demonstrate that engaging Wnt signaling at the receptor level by this method leads to necessary crosstalk between multiple signaling pathways including activation of Akt, mTOR, Wnt/β-catenin, PKA/CREB, and inhibition of RhoA/ROCK that substantially increase human β-cell proliferation while maintaining the β-cell phenotype. The cross-talk role of Wnt/β-catenin and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, with GSK-3β as the key enzyme bridging these pathways, may contribute to the inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma cells by hUC-MSCs. We find that Wnt stimulation leads to phosphorylation of insulin signaling key mediators, including Akt, GSK3β, and ERK1/2, although with a lower fold stimulation and slower time course than observed for insulin. Wnt induces phosphorylation of Akt, ERK1/2, and GSK3β, and this is dependent on insulin/IGF-1 receptors. Pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K resulted in the downregulation of several members of the β-catenin pathway, including Fra-1, c-Myc, and cyclin D1. Similar results were observed in vivo, as intratumoral injection of LY294002 downregulated the expression of the components of the β-catenin pathway and delayed tumor growth in nude mice harboring subcutaneous LN229 xenografts. These results suggest that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway regulates glioma cell proliferation, in part via repression of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Small-molecule inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signaling inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin pathway cross-talk and suppress medulloblastoma growth Small-molecule inhibitors targeting the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway affected beta-catenin signaling by activation [corrected] of GSK-3beta, [corrected] resulting in cytoplasmic retention of beta-catenin and reduced expression of its target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc. These findings demonstrate the importance of cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and beta-catenin pathways in medulloblastoma and rationalize the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway as a therapeutic target in treatment of this disease. Western blot analyses revealed that the recombinant Wnt ligand Wnt-3A increased phosphorylation of AKT and the downstream kinase glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta as well as accumulation of activated, nuclear beta-catenin. Chemical inhibition of PI3K abolished Wnt-dependent phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3beta and trophoblast motility but did not affect appearance of activated beta-catenin or Wnt/TCF reporter activity. The data suggest that Wnt-3A may activate canonical Wnt signaling and PI3K/AKT through distinct receptors. Mutational activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway occurs in a wide variety of tumors, whereas activating Wnt pathway mutants are predominantly found in colon cancer. Because GSK3 is a key component of both pathways, it is widely assumed that active PI3K signaling feeds positively into the Wnt pathway by protein kinase B (PKB)-mediatefd inhibition of GSK3. n addition, PKB has been proposed to modulate the canonical Wnt signaling through direct stabilization and nuclear localization of beta-catenin. Here, we show that compartmentalization by Axin of GSK3 prohibits cross-talk between the PI3K and Wnt pathways and that Wnt-mediated transcriptional activity is not modulated by activation of the PI3K/PKB pathway. Our recent study revealed a second mechanism for Cby-mediated beta-catenin inhibition in which Cby cooperates with 14-3-3 adaptor proteins to facilitate nuclear export of beta-catenin, following phosphorylation of Cby by Akt kinase. Therefore, our findings unravel a novel molecular mechanism regulating the dynamic nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking of beta-catenin and provide new insights into the cross-talk between the Wnt and Akt signaling pathways. Here, we review recent literature concerning Cby function and discuss our current understanding of the relationship between Wnt and Akt signaling. As inappropriate activation of WNT/CTNNB1 signaling causes late-onset GCT development and cross talk between the PI3K/AKT and WNT/CTNNB1 pathways has been reported, we tested whether these pathways could synergize in GCT. This explains why prostate tumors subjected to androgen ablation experience an increase in Akt phosphorylation, and suggest that the tumor compensates for the loss of one pathway with another. Different modes of interaction between the two pathways, including direct interaction, or regulation via downstream intermediates, such as the wnt/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin pathway, NF-kappaB, and the FOXO family of transcription factors, will be discussed. FGF signals are transduced through FGF receptor to the FRS2-GRB2-GAB1-PI3K-AKT signaling cascade to downregulate GSK3beta activity depending on Ser 9 phosphorylation. Because GSK3beta-dependent phosphorylation of beta-catenin and SNAIL leads to FBXW1 (betaTRCP)-mediated ubiquitination and degradation, GSK3beta downregulation results in the stabilization and the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and SNAIL. Bridging the BMP and Wnt pathways by PI3 kinase/Akt and 14-3-3zeta Concurrently, PTEN, an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt pathway, is also primarily inactivated in the ISCs, leading to activation of Akt. Thus, Akt may contribute to activation of beta-catenin in ISCs in coordination with Wnt signaling. Thus, we propose that BMP signaling plays a role in inhibition of ISC self-renewal through suppression of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in ISC, and this cross-talk is bridged, at least in part, through the PTEN/Akt pathway and further enforced by 14-3-3zeta. In MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cultures, dexamethasone (DEX) activates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) and inhibits a differentiation-related cell cycle that occurs at a commitment stage immediately after confluence. Here we show that DEX inhibition of the differentiation-related cell cycle is associated with a decrease in beta-catenin levels and inhibition of LEF/TCF-mediated transcription. These inhibitory activities are no longer observed in the presence of lithium, a GSK3beta inhibitor. DEX decreased the serum-responsive phosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt-Ser(473) within minutes, and this inhibition was also observed after 12 h. When the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway was inhibited by wortmannin, DEX no longer inhibited beta-catenin levels. Furthermore, DEX-mediated inhibition of LEF/TCF transcriptional activity was attenuated in the presence of dominant negative forms of either PI3K or protein kinase B/Akt. These results suggest cross-talk between the PI3K/Akt and Wnt signaling pathways. These results suggest that inhibition of a PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta/beta-catenin/LEF axis and stimulation of HDAC1 cooperate to mediate the inhibitory effect of DEX on Wnt signaling and the osteoblast differentiation-related cell cycle. WISP-1 (Wnt-1-induced secreted protein) was identified as an oncogene regulated by the Wnt-1-beta-catenin pathway. Here it is shown that WISP-1 can activate the antiapoptotic Akt/PKB signaling pathway.  Our results show that both TGFβ1 and Wnt3a lead to increased accumulation of β-catenin, phosphorylation of AKT and p44/42 MAPK.	yes
323	56ae71cb0a360a5e45000010	Is there evidence for de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates?	De novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates. Evolutionary innovation relies partially on changes in gene regulation. While a growing body of evidence demonstrates that such innovation is generated by functional changes or translocation of regulatory elements via mobile genetic elements, the de novo generation of enhancers from non-regulatory/non-mobile sequences has, to our knowledge, not previously been demonstrated. Here we show evidence for the de novo genesis of enhancers in vertebrates. For this, we took advantage of the massive gene loss following the last whole genome duplication in teleosts to systematically identify regions that have lost their coding capacity but retain sequence conservation with mammals. We found that these regions show enhancer activity while the orthologous coding regions have no regulatory activity. These results demonstrate that these enhancers have been de novo generated in fish. By revealing that minor changes in non-regulatory sequences are sufficient to generate new enhancers, our study highlights an important playground for creating new regulatory variability and evolutionary innovation.

334	54d762653706e89528000014	Can cognitive behavioral therapy improve fatigue in cancer patients?	Physical activity, educational interventions, and cognitive-behavioral therapy have the most supportive data and can be recommended to patients with confidence.  For women undergoing radiotherapy (3 RCTs), hypnosis combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy improved distress and fatigue. Patients in the CBT group reported a significantly larger decrease in fatigue scores than patients in the waiting list group. However, relative to VCBT-I, PCBT-I was associated with significantly greater improvements of insomnia severity, early morning awakenings, depression, fatigue, and dysfunctional beliefs about sleep.  CBT-I may also improve mood, fatigue, and overall quality of life, and can be successfully delivered through a variety of treatment modalities, making it possible to reach a broader range of patients who may not have access to more traditional programs.  No group differences in improvement were noted relative to QOL, fatigue, or mood.  In case of persistent fatigue, personalized cognitive behavioral therapy can be considered. ONCLUSION: The results support CBTH as an evidence-based intervention to control fatigue in patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer.  Severe fatigue after cancer treatment can be treated effectively with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but it is unclear whether CBT has an effect on cognitive functioning. CONCLUSION: CBT for post-cancer fatigue has already been shown to be an effective therapy.  Frequently reported side effects include cancer-related fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, and psychological distress. Exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy interventions have counteracted such adverse effects in other cancer populations.  There is evidence from methodologically rigorous controlled trials that exercise, psycho-educational interventions, and cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia are effective in the treatment of CRF, and a wide range of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions has shown initial promise in single-arm pilot studies with small, heterogeneous samples.  CONCLUSIONS: Physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy and physical training alone had significant and beneficial effects on fatigue compared with no intervention. Physical training was equally effective as or more effective than physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing cancer-related fatigue, suggesting that cognitive-behavioral therapy did not have additional beneficial effects beyond the benefits of physical training. RESULTS: Imagery/hypnosis and CBT/CST interventions have produced improvement in all the three cancer-related symptoms individually: pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance. RESULTS: Multilevel modeling indicated that for weekly FACIT fatigue data, there was a significant effect of the CBTH intervention on the rate of change in fatigue (p < .05), such that on average, CBTH participants' fatigue did not increase over the course of treatment, whereas control group participants' fatigue increased linearly. ONCLUSION: The results suggest that CBTH is an effective means for controlling and potentially preventing fatigue in breast cancer radiotherapy patients. Results were consistent with the view that CBTH was effective in managing fatigue and skin discomfort, and increasing relaxation. RESULTS: Participants in the Internet group showed significant improvements at post-assessment compared with those in the control group in overall insomnia severity (F(1,26) = 22.8; p<0.001), sleep efficiency (F(1,24) = 11.45; P = 0.002), sleep onset latency (F(1,24) = 5.18; P = 0.03), soundness of sleep (F(1,24) = 9.34; P = 0.005), restored feeling upon awakening (F(1,24) = 11.95; P = 0.002), and general fatigue (F(1,26) = 13.88; P = 0.001).  Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) has alleviated fatigue and improved QOL of cancer patients; however, little is known about the effects of nurse-led CBT on breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Physical training was equally effective as or more effective than physical training combined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in reducing cancer-related fatigue, suggesting that cognitive-behavioral therapy did not have additional beneficial effects beyond the benefits of physical training.

338	56b8a222156496395c000001	Are conserved noncoding elements associated with the evolution of animal body plans?	"Here, we discuss the evidence that CNEs are part of the core gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that specify alternative animal body plans. The major animal groups arose>550 million years ago. We propose that the cis-regulatory inputs identified by CNEs arose during the ""re-wiring"" of regulatory interactions that occurred during early animal evolution. Consequently, different animal groups, with different core GRNs, contain alternative sets of CNEs. Due to the subsequent stability of animal body plans, these core regulatory sequences have been evolving in parallel under strong purifying selection in different animal groups.

376	532627d0d6d3ac6a34000001	Does ventriculoperitoneal shunt improve normal pressure hydrocephalus?	"Clinical improvement depends not only on the capability to restore the cerebrospinal fluid dynamic, but also on the ability of cerebral parenchyma to recover the metabolic function.  After shunting, the global CMRglu significantly increased (2.95 ± 0.44 vs 4.38 ± 0.68, p = 10(-7)) in all INPH patients with a mean percentage value of 48.7%.  Our preliminary data show that changes in the CMRglu are promptly reversible after surgery and that there is a relationship between the early metabolic changes and clinical symptoms, independently from the simultaneous changes in the ventricular size. The remarkable and prompt improvement in the global CMRglu and in symptoms may also have important implications for the current concept of ""neuronal plasticity"" and for the cells' reactivity in order to recover their metabolic function. Outcome of shunting in INPH is most often successful when patients are accurately diagnosed, suitably evaluated for surgical candidacy, and managed carefully throughout the preoperative, surgical, and postoperative periods. The decision to perform the only efficient procedure, i.e., a ventricular shunt operation, depends upon a number of established arguments in favor of that procedure. Clinical improvement, which is often spectacular, can then confirm the diagnosis.  During the 1st postoperative year, there was improvement in the condition of 22 patients (96%) who had received a ventricular shunt; 21 of these patients (91%) remained improved until death or for at least 5 years. Shunt treatment showed an effect on cognitive functions of distractibility of attention and motor speed, but not on intelligence of memory. Three patients deteriorated, eleven remained stable and sixteen showed significant improvement on psychological tests, mainly those for attention, motor speed and memory, but rarely did any improvement of intelligence occur."	yes

We explain a protocol for the reproducible generation of genetically corrected iPSCs starting from the skin biopsies of Fanconi anemia patients using retroviral transduction with OCT4, SOX2 and KLF4 Before reprogramming, the fibroblasts and/or keratinocytes of the patients are genetically corrected with lentiviruses expressing FANCA. Disease-corrected haematopoietic progenitors from Fanconi anaemia induced pluripotent stem cells Here we show that, on correction of the genetic defect, somatic cells from Fanconi anaemia patients can be reprogrammed to pluripotency to generate patient-specific iPS cells. These cell lines appear indistinguishable from human embryonic stem cells and iPS cells from healthy individuals Most importantly, we show that corrected Fanconi-anaemia-specific iPS cells can give rise to haematopoietic progenitors of the myeloid and erythroid lineages that are phenotypically normal, that is, disease-free	yes

433	56caf71b5795f9a73e00002d	Is STAT3 transcription factor regulated by mTORC1?	Mechanistically, mTORC1 mediated IL-6-induced Stat3 activation in intestinal epithelial cells to stimulate the expression of downstream targets essential for cell proliferation and tissue regeneration. Therefore, mTORC1 signaling critically protects against inflammatory bowel disease through modulation of inflammation-induced Stat3 activity. we demonstrated that STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling was activated by excess amino acids, which then positively regulated Notch1 expression through the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process Furthermore, we demonstrated that STAT3 is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser727 during hypoxia, promoting HIF-1α mRNA transcription. mTORC1 also regulates HIF-1α synthesis on a translational level via co-operative regulation of both initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 (S6K1), whereas HIF-1α degradation remains unaffected Here we present evidence for the involvement of STAT3, a known mTORC1 regulated transcription factor, in this process.  TSC1/TSC2 inactivation inhibits AKT through mTORC1-dependent up-regulation of STAT3-PTEN cascade. Mechanistically, mTORC1 signaling was activated by excess amino acids, which then positively regulated Notch1 expression through the activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).  Suppression of the mTORC1/STAT3/Notch1 pathway by activated AMPK prevents hepatic insulin resistance induced by excess amino acids. Here, we review the connections between mTORC1 and gene transcription by focusing on its impact in regulating the activation of specific transcription factors including including STAT3, SREBPs, PPARγ, PPARα, HIF1α, YY1–PGC1α and TFEB. We also discuss the importance of these transcription factors in mediating the effects of mTORC1 on various cellular processes in physiological and pathological contexts.	yes

Participation of Korean families at high risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in BRCA1/2 genetic testing. The prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations in Korean ovarian cancer patients irrespective of the family history was significantly higher than previously reported. Possible founder mutations in Korean ovarian cancer patients were identified. Germline Mutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Korean Ovarian Cancer Patients: Finding Founder Mutations. The assessment of BRCA1 and BRCA2 coding sequences to identify pathogenic mutations associated with inherited breast/ovarian cancer syndrome has provided a method to identify high-risk individuals, allowing them to seek preventative treatments and strategies.  Maximising survival: the main concern of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer who undergo genetic testing for BRCA1/2.  Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term. This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time. The strongest evidence was for rs1466785 in the NEIL2 (endonuclease VIII-like 2) gene (HR: 1.09, 95% CI (1.03-1.16), p = 2.7 × 10(-3)) for association with breast cancer risk in BRCA2 mutation carriers, and rs2304277 in the OGG1 (8-guanine DNA glycosylase) gene, with ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 mutation carriers (HR: 1.12 95%CI: 1.03-1.21, p = 4.8 × 10(-3)). Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility.  Large BRCA1 and BRCA2 genomic rearrangements in Polish high-risk breast and ovarian cancer families. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are two major genes associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. Until 2006, she supervised a diagnostic unit for BRCA gene testing at the Interdisciplinary Center for Hereditary Breast Cancer (Max Delbrück Center, Berlin, Germany).  Inherited BRCA gene mutations convey a high risk for breast and ovarian cancer, but current guidelines limit BRCA mutation testing to women with early-onset cancer and relatives of mutation-positive cases.  Women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation face a risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer at an earlier age than women without such a mutation. In 2006, participants were recruited from Web sites for women with breast cancer or BRCA gene mutations.  About 20 % of hereditary breast cancers are caused by mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Since BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations may be spread throughout the gene, genetic testing is usually performed by direct sequencing of entire coding regions. Suggestion of an association between BRCA2 c.7806-2A>G and risk of breast cancer in males has emerged.  The presence of deleterious mutations in breast cancer (BRCA)-1 or BRCA-2 gene has a decisive influence on the development of various types of neoplasms, such as breast, ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers.  OBJECTIVE: Female BRCA (breast cancer gene)-1 and BRCA-2 mutations are significantly associated with risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, in turn, associated with female infertility. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for 5-10% of breast and ovarian cancer cases. She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies. BACKGROUND: Women who are diagnosed with a deleterious mutation in either breast cancer (BRCA) gene have a high risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers at young ages. We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. [Detection and occurrence of BRCA 1 gene mutation in patients with carcinoma of the breast and ovary]. We investigated the relationship between BRCA mutations and the distribution of familial cancers other than breast or ovary in high-risk breast cancer patients.PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO HAD AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS WERE ENROLLED: reported family history of breast or ovarian cancer; 40 years of age or younger age at diagnosis; bilateral breast cancer; or male gender Mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) are associated with increased risks for breast, ovarian, and other types of cancer.To review new evidence on the benefits and harms of risk assessment, genetic counseling, and genetic testing for BRCA-related cancer in women.MEDLINE and PsycINFO between 2004 and 30 July 2013, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 2004 through the second quarter of 2013, Health Technology Assessment during the fourth quarter of 2012, Scopus, and reference lists.English-language studies about accuracy of risk assessment and benefits and harms of genetic counseling, genetic testing, and interventions to reduce cancer incidence and mortality. The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of primary breast cancer (PBC) and contralateral breast cancer (CBC) in patients who had BRCA1/BRCA2-associated epithelial ovarian cancer (OC).From the database of the Rotterdam Family Cancer Clinic, patients who had BRCA-associated OC without a history of unilateral breast cancer (BC) (at risk of PBC; n = 79) or with a history of unilateral BC (at risk of CBC; n = 37) were selected Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families.Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations The USPSTF also reviewed interventions aimed at reducing the risk for BRCA-related cancer in women with potentially harmful BRCA mutations, including intensive cancer screening, medications, and risk-reducing surgery.This recommendation applies to asymptomatic women who have not been diagnosed with BRCA-related cancer.The USPSTF recommends that primary care providers screen women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal, or peritoneal cancer with 1 of several screening tools designed to identify a family history that may be associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA1 or BRCA2) If a woman bearing a mutation develops cancer in one breast, her risk of developing cancer in the other breast depends on the particular gene that is mutated and on her age at the onset of disease.About half of all monogenically determined carcinomas of the breast and ovary are due to a mutation in one or the other of the highly penetrant BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) A value of RHR greater than 1 indicated elevated breast cancer risk; a value of RHR less than 1 indicated elevated ovarian cancer risk.Mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2.Breast and ovarian cancer risks.Among BRCA1 mutation carriers, 9052 women (46%) were diagnosed with breast cancer, 2317 (12%) with ovarian cancer, 1041 (5%) with breast and ovarian cancer, and 7171 (37%) without cancer This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.METHODS: A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries.  Little is known about how women with hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer who test positive for a BRCA gene manage the impact of a positive test result on their everyday lives and in the longer term. This study defined the experience and needs of women with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and a positive BRCA test over time.A grounded theory approach was taken using qualitative interviews (n = 49) and reflective diaries. Women with a harmful mutation in the BReast CAncer (BRCA) gene are at significantly increased risk of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) during their lifetime, compared to those without. Genetic testing for BRCA genes, associated with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer risk, is an accepted cancer control strategy. Younger patients, those with a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and those diagnosed more recently were more likely to be BRCA tested. Mutations in BRCA genes elevate risk for breast and ovarian cancer. Observational studies of prophylactic surgeries report reduced risks for breast and ovarian cancer in mutation carriers.No data describe the range of risk associated with BRCA mutations, genetic heterogeneity, and moderating factors; studies conducted in highly selected populations contain biases; and information on adverse effects is incomplete.A primary care approach to screening for inherited breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility has not been evaluated, and evidence is lacking to determine benefits and harms for the general population. We identified AJ individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer undergoing hereditary breast/ovarian cancer risk assessment since 2006 without evidence of a deleterious mutation on BRCA gene sequencing who were screened for major gene rearrangements in BRCA1 and BRCA2. For each proband, the pre-test probability of identifying a deleterious BRCA mutation was estimated using the Myriad II model. We identified 108 affected individuals who underwent large rearrangement testing (80 breast cancer, 19 ovarian cancer, nine both breast and ovarian cancer). Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size.RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer. One asymptomatic person--carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation--was identified in this study. She was daughter of a woman, a carrier of BRCA 1 gene mutation, with early onset of breast cancer and positive family history.CONCLUSIONS: BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 gene mutations are of particular importance in the increasing risk of ovarian cancer and early onset of breast cancer as well as some other malignancies. Germline BRCA gene mutations are reportedly associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Identification of BRCA mutations greatly improves the preventive strategies and management of breast cancer. Statistically significant earlier ages at diagnosis also were observed within subgroups of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, maternal inheritance, paternal inheritance, breast cancer only, and breast cancer-identified and ovarian cancer-identified families.CONCLUSIONS: Breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA mutation carriers appeared to be diagnosed at an earlier age in later generations. Truncated proteins are easily discriminated from full size.RESULTS: Three BRCA 1 gene alterations were identified in the investigated group of women suffering from ovarian or breast cancer. However, some single risk factors without family histories (early-onset breast cancer, male breast cancer, or multiple organ cancers) may limit the utility of BRCA gene testing in the Korean population. BRCA Mutations Increase Fertility in Families at Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer Risk. Because infertility is associated with breast and ovarian cancer risks, we hypothesized that the mutations in the BRCA gene may be associated with low response to fertility treatments. Moreover, in families of breast cancer patients without BRCA mutations, breast cancer risk depends on the patient's age at diagnosis. Among the 554 women who underwent genetic testing for BRCA mutation, 78 were found to have a deleterious mutation in the BRCA1 gene, and 54 had a mutation in the BRCA 2 gene. Frequent recurrent mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 among Hispanics, including a large rearrangement Mexican founder mutation (BRCA1 exon 9-12 deletion [ex9-12del]), suggest that an ancestry-informed BRCA-testing strategy could reduce disparities and promote cancer prevention by enabling economic screening for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in Mexico. Individuals who carry a BRCA gene mutation have increased lifetime risks of developing hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome-related cancers. BRCA gene mutations have been well described to carry an increased risk of both breast and ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer among 8,005 women from a breast cancer family history clinic: no increased risk of invasive ovarian cancer in families testing negative for BRCA1 and BRCA2. Women who were BRCA carriers, women who had a history of breast cancer, DCIS, or breast biopsy, or had a family history of ovarian cancer were more likely to have undergone surgery for cancer risk reduction. Genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility became a reality after two cancer predisposition genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, were identified. Germline mutations in BRCA genes are associated with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility. We used person-years at risk to assess ovarian cancer rates in the study population, subdivided by genetic status (BRCA1, BRCA2, BRCA negative, BRCA untested) compared with the general population.	yes
487	58cbb55402b8c60953000033	Does oculocutaneous albinism show an autosomal recessive inheritance?	"Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hypopigmentation in eyes, hair and skin, accompanied with vision loss.  Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive hereditary pigmentation disorder affecting humans and several other animal species.  Oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2) is a human autosomal-recessive hypopigmentation disorder associated with pathological mutations of the OCA2 gene. Oculocutaneous albinism type1 (OCA1) is characterized by the absence of melanin pigmentation. The mutation on TYR gene makes OCA1 as an autosomal recessive genetic disorder.  Our patients were diagnosed as affected with Oculocutaneous albinism type1a. Analysis of pedigree pattern showed an autosomal recessive inheritance.  Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder of melanin biosynthesis that results in congenital hypopigmentation of ocular and cutaneous tissues. Oculocutaneous albinism is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. Melanin biosynthesis is reduced in oculocutaneous albinism, an autosomal recessive disorder. The pedigrees were consistent with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.CONCLUSION: This unique type of oculocutaneous albinism has heterogeneous clinical features. BACKGROUND: Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive hereditary pigmentation disorder affecting humans and several other animal species. The Q402 allele has been associated with autosomal recessive ocular albinism when it is in trans with a tyrosinase gene mutation associated with oculocutaneous albinism type 1. Analysis using the POINTER program showed that this type of oculocutaneous albinism was inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, with an estimated gene frequency of 0.025 +/- 0.007 in this population. We have identified 12 families with oculocutaneous albinism type 1 that exhibit segregation of the c.1205G>A variant with a known pathologic mutation on the homologous chromosome, and demonstrate no genetic association between autosomal recessive oculocutaneous albinism and the Q402 variant. BACKGROUND: Type II (tyrosinase-positive) oculocutaneous albinism is an autosomal recessive disorder that has recently been mapped to chromosome segment 15q11-q13. The child with ocular albinism was heterozygous for two different mutations in the P gene.CONCLUSIONS: Abnormalities of the P gene are associated with a wide range of clinical phenotypes, including type II oculocutaneous albinism, albinism associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome, and at least some cases of autosomal recessive ocular albinism. Mutations in the TYR gene (TYR, 11q14-21, MIM 606933) cause oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1, MIM 203100), a developmental disorder having an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance The pedigrees were consistent with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.This unique type of oculocutaneous albinism has heterogeneous clinical features Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder of abnormal melanin formation, which results in hypopigmentation of skin, hair and eyes The mutation of the tyrosinase (TYR) gene results in oculocutaneous albinism type 1 (OCA1), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder We found oculo-cutaneous albinism in two brothers and granular dystrophy in three brothers, the mother and a son.Corneal dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder inherited independently of oculocutaneous albinism, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) type 4 is a newly identified human autosomal recessive hypopigmentary disorder that disrupts pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes Analysis using the POINTER program showed that this type of oculocutaneous albinism was inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, with an estimated gene frequency of 0.025 +/- 0.007 in this population.  DISCUSSION: Corneal dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder inherited independently of oculocutaneous albinism, which is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition.

492	58b6d26122d300530900000e	Is infertility characteristic of individuals with Fanconi anemia?	PALB2 links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in homologous recombinational repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Mono-allelic mutations in PALB2 increase the risk of breast, pancreatic, and other cancers, and biallelic mutations cause Fanconi anemia (FA).  Moreover, mutant males showed reduced fertility due to impaired meiosis and increased apoptosis in germ cells. Interestingly, mutant meiocytes showed a significant defect in sex chromosome synapsis, which likely contributed to the germ cell loss and fertility defect. In females with Fanconi anemia (FA), infertility is often accompanied by diminished ovarian reserve and hypergonadotropic amenorrhea before the age of 30 years, suggesting primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Substantially reduced AMH levels in females with FA suggest a primary ovarian defect associated with reduced fertility. Measurement of AMH at the time of FA diagnosis and subsequent monitoring of AMH levels at regular intervals may be useful for the timely management of complications related to POI such as subfertility/infertility, osteoporosis, and menopausal symptoms. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human disease of bone marrow failure, leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, and developmental anomalies, including hypogonadism and infertility.  Reduced fertility is one clinical manifestation among other well known Fanconi anemia features.  Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human disease of bone marrow failure, leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, and developmental anomalies, including hypogonadism and infertility Targeted disruption of exons 1 to 6 of the Fanconi Anemia group A gene leads to growth retardation, strain-specific microphthalmia, meiotic defects and primordial germ cell hypoplasia. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a human disease of bone marrow failure, leukemia, squamous cell carcinoma, and developmental anomalies, including hypogonadism and infertility. To potentially reduce late effects of malignancy, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), endocrinopathy, and infertility in patients with Fanconi anemia (FA) undergoing HLA-matched related donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), we developed a regimen using fludarabine (FLU), cyclophosphamide (CY), and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) followed by infusion of T-cell depleted (TCD) bone marrow (BM) or unmanipulated umbilical cord blood (UCB). Mutations in Fanca account for the majority of cases of Fanconi anemia (FA), a recessively inherited disease identified by congenital defects, bone marrow failure, infertility, and cancer susceptibility. FANCA is mutated in more than 60% of cases of Fanconi anemia (FA), a rare genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, endocrine tissue cancer susceptibility, and infertility. In females with Fanconi anemia (FA), infertility is often accompanied by diminished ovarian reserve and hypergonadotropic amenorrhea before the age of 30 years, suggesting primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). Fanconi anemia (FA) is a complex cancer susceptibility disorder associated with DNA repair defects and infertility, yet the precise function of the FA proteins in genome maintenance remains unclear. Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genetic disease resulting in bone marrow failure, high cancer risks, and infertility, and developmental anomalies including microphthalmia, microcephaly, hypoplastic radius and thumb.	yes
513	5883781b2305cd7e21000001	Does Jarid2 play a role in early embryo development?	Jarid2 Coordinates Nanog Expression and PCP/Wnt Signaling Required for Efficient ESC Differentiation and Early Embryo Development Unlike other PRC2-deficient embryonic stem cells (ESCs), however, Jarid2-deficient ESCs show a severe differentiation block, altered colony morphology, and distinctive patterns of deregulated gene expression. Here, we show that Jarid2(-/-) ESCs express constitutively high levels of Nanog but reduced PCP signaling components Wnt9a, Prickle1, and Fzd2 and lowered β-catenin activity. Depletion of Wnt9a/Prickle1/Fzd2 from wild-type ESCs or overexpression of Nanog largely phenocopies these cellular defects. Co-culture of Jarid2(-/-) with wild-type ESCs restores variable Nanog expression and β-catenin activity and can partially rescue the differentiation block of mutant cells. In addition, we show that ESCs lacking Jarid2 or Wnt9a/Prickle1/Fzd2 or overexpressing Nanog induce multiple ICM formation when injected into normal E3.5 blastocysts. These data describe a previously unrecognized role for Jarid2 in regulating a core pluripotency and Wnt/PCP signaling circuit that is important for ESC differentiation and for pre-implantation development. Jarid2 Coordinates Nanog Expression and PCP/Wnt Signaling Required for Efficient ESC Differentiation and Early Embryo Development. Consistent with an essential role for PcG proteins in early development, we demonstrate that JARID2 is required for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells. Jumonij (JMJ)/Jarid2 plays important roles in embryonic development and functions as a transcriptional repressor. Thus, these results demonstrate that JARID2 is essential for the binding of PcG proteins to target genes and, consistent with this, for the proper differentiation of embryonic stem cells and normal development. JARID2 is an accessory component of Polycomb repressive complex-2 (PRC2) required for the differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Jarid2 Coordinates Nanog Expression and PCP/Wnt Signaling Required for Efficient ESC Differentiation and Early Embryo Development.

550	58df5efbc784871774000001	Is dupilumab an antibody targeting the IL-1 receptor?	Atopic dermatitis (AD) is characterized by type 2 helper T (Th2) cell-driven inflammation. Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-4 receptor α subunit that blocks the signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, both key cytokines in Th2-mediated pathways. Dupilumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interteukin-4R is the first antibody (i.e. 'biological') with published efficacy shown in controlled prospective studies in atopic dermatitis.  Dupilumab, a human monoclonal antibody against interleukin-4 receptor alpha, inhibits signaling of interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, type 2 cytokines that may be important drivers of atopic or allergic diseases such as atopic dermatitis. Best evidence of the clinical efficacy of novel immunologic approaches using biological agents in patients with AD is available for the anti-IL-4 receptor α-chain antibody dupilumab, but a number of studies are currently ongoing with other specific antagonists to immune system players.  Dupilumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-4 receptor α monoclonal antibody, inhibits interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signalling, key drivers of type-2-mediated inflammation.  Dupilumab was also introduced as a possible treatment for patients with severe pemphigus. It can directly inhibit IL-4 by targeting IL-4 α-chain receptor.

561	5a3566bb966455904c000003	Does TFIIS affect nucleosome positioning?	Transcript cleavage factor TFIIS reactivates the backtracked complexes and promotes pol II transcription through the nucleosome.  The same nucleosomes transcribed in the opposite orientation form a weaker, more diffuse barrier that is largely relieved by higher salt, TFIIS, or FACT The system contains natural or recombinant histones, chromatin assembly factors, the histone-acetyltransferase p300, all components of the general transcription machinery, general coactivators and the elongation factor SII (TFIIS). Efficient and rapid nucleosome traversal by RNA polymerase II depends on a combination of transcript elongation factors. We now show that although TFIIF or TFIIS alone is modestly stimulatory for nucleosome traversal, both factors together increase transcription through nucleosomes in a synergistic manner. Significantly, we found that nucleosomes with a Sin mutant histone are traversed to the same extent and at nearly the same rate as equivalent pure DNA templates if both TFIIS and TFIIF are present. After partial uncoiling of nucleosomal DNA from histone octamer by Pol II and backtracking of the enzyme, nucleosomal DNA recoils on the octamer, locking Pol II in the arrested state. Histone chaperones and transcription factors TFIIS, TFIIF and FACT facilitate transcription through chromatin using different molecular mechanisms. Transcript cleavage factor TFIIS reactivates the backtracked complexes and promotes pol II transcription through the nucleosome. The highly conserved eukaryotic transcriptional elongation factor TFIIS enables RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to read though pause or termination sites, nucleosomes and sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. We also studied the effect of TFIIF and TFIIS on transcription of nucleosomes containing a Sin mutant histone. The same nucleosomes transcribed in the opposite orientation form a weaker, more diffuse barrier that is largely relieved by higher salt, TFIIS, or FACT.	yes

579	58e8a2fc3e8b6dc87c00000c	Do cephalopods use RNA editing less frequently than other species?	Extensive messenger RNA editing generates transcript and protein diversity in genes involved in neural excitability, as previously described, as well as in genes participating in a broad range of other cellular functions By adopting a method originally designed to detect linkage disequilibrium of DNA mutations, we examined the editomes of ten metazoan species and detected extensive linkage of editing in Drosophila and cephalopods. We here show that RNA editing is particularly common in behaviorally sophisticated coleoid cephalopods, with tens of thousands of evolutionarily conserved sites. Even for the subset of RNA editing sites shared by deeply divergent cephalopod lineages, the primary effect of nuclear editing is an increase-not a decrease-in protein divergence. Coleoid cephalopods (octopus, squid and cuttlefish) are active, resourceful predators with a rich behavioural repertoire. We identified hundreds of cephalopod-specific genes, many of which showed elevated expression levels in such specialized structures as the skin, the suckers and the nervous system. Our analysis suggests that substantial expansion of a handful of gene families, along with extensive remodelling of genome linkage and repetitive content, played a critical role in the evolution of cephalopod morphological innovations, including their large and complex nervous systems.	no

A phase Ib multiple ascending dose study of the safety, tolerability, and central nervous system availability of AZD0530 (saracatinib) in Alzheimer's disease. Herein, we present a Phase Ib trial of the repurposed investigational drug AZD0530, a Src family kinase inhibitor specific for Fyn and Src kinase, for the treatment of patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The study was a 4-week Phase Ib multiple ascending dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of AZD0530 in AD patients with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores ranging from 16 to 26. A total of 24 subjects were recruited in three sequential groups, with each randomized to receive oral AZD0530 at doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 125 mg, or placebo daily for 4 weeks.  AZD0530 is reasonably safe and well tolerated in patients with mild-to-moderate AD, achieving substantial central nervous system penetration with oral dosing at 100-125 mg. Targeting Fyn kinase may be a promising therapeutic approach in AD, and a larger Phase IIa clinical trial of AZD0530 for the treatment of patients with AD has recently launched.	yes

Transthyretin-associated familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) is a disease caused by the deposit of abnormal transthyretin on tissues, mainly nerves transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy We report a new transthyretin (ATTR) gene c.272C>G mutation and variant protein, p.Leu32Val, in a kindred of Bolivian origin with a rapid progressive peripheral neuropathy and cardiomyopat Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder, first described in families with sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy. Abnormal deposition of aggregated wild-type (WT) human transthyretin (TTR) and its pathogenic variants is responsible for cardiomyopathy and neuropathy related to TTR amyloidosis.  Transthyretin (TTR), normally a plasma circulating protein, can become misfolded and aggregated, ultimately leading to extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils usually targeted to heart or nerve tissues. Referred to as TTR-associated amyloidoses (ATTR), this group of diseases is frequently life threatening and fatal if untreated Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder, first described in families with sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy. Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is usually characterised by a progressive peripheral and autonomic neuropathy often with associated cardiac failure and is due to dominantly inherited transthyretin mutations causing accelerated amyloid deposition.	yes
600	5a70e1d999e2c3af26000007	Is Solanezumab effective for Alzheimer's Disease?	An analysis of publicly available data from the Phase II studies for bapineuzumab and solanezumab indicates that neither compound produced compelling evidence of drug-like behavior that would justify their progression into pivotal trials.  Notably, a recent study of solanezumab, an amyloid β monoclonal antibody, raises hope for the further therapeutic potential of immunotherapy, not only in Alzheimer's disease, but also for other neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease.  For example, Eli Lilly announced a major change to its closely watched clinical trial for the Alzheimer's drug solanezumab which failed to reach statistical significance.  Areas covered: This contradiction prompted us to review all study phases of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG), Bapineuzumab, Solanezumab, Avagacestat and Dimebolin to shed more light on these recent failures.   Results from phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with two monoclonal antibodies bapineuzumab and solanezumab and intravenous immunoglobulin have been disappointing. Subsequent analysis of pooled data from both phase III trials with solanezumab showed a reduction in cognitive decline in patients with mild AD. Secondary analyses of EXPEDITION studies suggested a smaller functional effect of solanezumab relative to cognition. An increasing effect of solanezumab over 18 months was shown for cognition and function. RESULTS: In the mild AD population, less cognitive and functional decline was observed with solanezumab (n = 659) versus placebo (n = 663), measured by Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living functional scale Instrumental ADLs.  The promising results obtained with aducanumab and solanezumab against Alzheimer's disease (AD) strengthen the vaccine approach to prevent AD, despite of the many clinical setbacks.  CONCLUSIONS: Solanezumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds amyloid, failed to improve cognition or functional ability.  Results from phase III clinical trials in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with two monoclonal antibodies bapineuzumab and solanezumab and intravenous immunoglobulin have been disappointing.	no
601	5a6fabfeb750ff4455000062	Are there mammalian promoters with distal enhancer functions?	Genome-wide characterization of mammalian promoters with distal enhancer functions. Gene expression in mammals is precisely regulated by the combination of promoters and gene-distal regulatory regions, known as enhancers. Several studies have suggested that some promoters might have enhancer functions. However, the extent of this type of promoters and whether they actually function to regulate the expression of distal genes have remained elusive. Here, by exploiting a high-throughput enhancer reporter assay, we unravel a set of mammalian promoters displaying enhancer activity. These promoters have distinct genomic and epigenomic features and frequently interact with other gene promoters. Extensive CRISPR-Cas9 genomic manipulation demonstrated the involvement of these promoters in the cis regulation of expression of distal genes in their natural loci. Our results have important implications for the understanding of complex gene regulation in normal development and disease.

Down syndrome (DS; trisomy 21) is the most common survivable disorder due to aneuploidy. Down syndrome (DS), trisomy 21, is caused by increased dose of genes present on human chromosome 21 (HSA21) Down syndrome, or Trisomy 21, is the most frequently occurring chromosomal abnormality in live-born children.  Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, Submicroscopic duplication of chromosome 21 and trisomy 21 phenotype (Down syndrome). Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome is a chromosomal disorder resulting from the presence of all or part of an extra Chromosome 21. Down syndrome is a genetic disorder, occurring when an individual has all or part of an extra copy of chromosome 21. Downs syndrome (DS) occurs due to an extra copy of chromosome 21. Down syndrome, which arises in individuals carrying an extra copy of chromosome 21, is associated with a greatly increased risk of early-onset Alzheimer disease. Aneuploidy refers to the presence of an extra copy of a specific chromosome, or trisomy, as seen in Down's syndrome (trisomy 21), or the absence of a single chromosome, or monosomy, as seen in Turner syndrome (a single X chromosome in females: 45, X). Down syndrome (DS) or Trisomy 21 (Ts21) is caused by the presence of an extra copy of all or part of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) and is the most frequent survivable congenital chromosomal abnormality. Down syndrome (DS) is a major cause of mental retardation and heart disease. Although it is usually caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 21, a subset of the diagnostic features may be caused by the presence of only band 21q22. Down syndrome is usually caused by complete trisomy 21. Down syndrome, the most frequent genetic disorder, is characterized by an extra copy of all or part of chromosome 21. Down syndrome (DS), caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21, affects 1 in 750 live births and is characterized by cognitive impairment and a constellation of congenital defects. Down syndrome (DS) results from one extra copy of human chromosome 21 and leads to several alterations including intellectual disabilities and locomotor defects. Down's syndrome results from the production of three copies of chromosome 21 within a cell.  Downs syndrome (DS) occurs due to an extra copy of chromosome 21.

16	52df887498d023950500000c	Is oxalate renal excretion increased after bariatric surgery?	Despite the fact that bariatric surgery-induced weight loss is associated with a significant decrease in morbidity and mortality and improvement in renal function, bariatric surgery has recently been shown to be associated with a significant risk of nephrolithiasis. The main risk factor for nephrolithiasis is increased excretion of urinary oxalate. Enteric hyperoxaluria, nephrolithiasis, and oxalate nephropathy must be considered with the other risks of RYGBP. The urinary excretion of oxalate was high: 1.112 mumol/24 h (normal range: 55-400 mumol/24 h), and citrate excretion was low: 1.48 mmol/24 h (normal range: 2-5 mmol/24 h).  Hyperoxaluria in patients with JIB was found to be a result of hyperabsorption of oxalate, and these patients displayed altered oxalate kinetics with continued urinary excretion of orally administered 14C-oxalate for more than 48 hours.  Malabsorption of calcium and low fasting urinary calcium excretion in the JIB patients were associated with high tubular reabsorption of calcium, the latter presumably attributable to a compensatory increase in circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH). In most recurrent renal stone formers the urinary calcium concentration was increased, with an inverse relationship to serum PTH, indicating intestinal hyperabsorption of calcium. A	yes
26	56cae40b5795f9a73e000022	Is Crohn's disease (CD) linked to the consumption of refrigerated food?	Environmental risk factors playing a causative role in Crohn's Disease (CD) remain largely unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that refrigerated food could be involved in disease development. This study supports the opinion that CD is associated with exposure to domestic refrigeration, among other household factors, during childhood. Patients were exposed earlier than controls to the refrigerator (X2 = 9.9, df = 3, P = 0.04) and refrigerator exposure at birth was found to be a risk factor for CD (OR = 2.08 (95% CI: 1.01-4.29), P = 0.05). Comparable results were obtained looking for the exposure to freezer at home. A recent published hypothesis proposed that Crohn's disease was provoked by infantile exposure to micro-organisms that can survive refrigerator temperature. This support for the hypothesis reached statistical significance for those with Crohn's disease compared to the controls (p=0.045). Epidemiological data allow assessment of familial environmental risk factors related to western lifestyle, diet, bacteria, and domestic hygiene. All findings point to refrigeration as a potential risk factor for Crohn's disease. Furthermore, cold-chain development paralleled the outbreak of Crohn's disease during the 20th century.  Environmental risk factors playing a causative role in Crohn&apos;s Disease (CD) remain largely unknown. Recently, it has been suggested that refrigerated food could be involved in disease development. Our study suggests an association between the omission of breakfast and the failure to refrigerate food with GC in the Mexican population.	yes
30	571e3e2abb137a4b0c000008	Are OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 associated with bilirubin transport?	OATP1B1 and OATP1B3-mediated transport of bilirubin was confirmed and inhibition was determined for atazanavir, rifampicin, indinavir, amprenavir, cyclosporine, rifamycin SV and saquinavir.  Examples of adaptive nontoxic changes in liver function, which may elevate direct (conjugated) and/or indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin above baseline levels, include reversible inhibition of UGT1A1-mediated bilirubin metabolism and OATP1B1-, OATP1B3-, or MRP2-mediated transport (Keogh. Due to limited solubility and poor ionization of bilirubin and its glucuronide, the formation of estradiol 3-glucuronide was used as a surrogate to assess UGT1A1 activity, while the transport of pitavastatin, CDCF, and taurocholate were used as surrogate probe substrates to monitor the function of OATP1B1/OATP1B3, MRP2, and BSEP, respectively. OATP1B1 and OATP1B3-mediated transport of bilirubin was confirmed and inhibition was determined for atazanavir, rifampicin, indinavir, amprenavir, cyclosporine, rifamycin SV and saquinavir. However, because drug transporters also contribute to bilirubin elimination, the purpose of this work was to investigate the in vitro inhibition of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MRP2, and BSEP of select test drugs known to elicit hyperbilirubinemia. Thus, disruption of hepatic reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia.Moreover, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial drug toxicity risks. Bilirubin elimination is a multifaceted process consisting of uptake of bilirubin into the hepatocytes facilitated by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Complete OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiency causes human Rotor syndrome by interrupting conjugated bilirubin reuptake into the liver. Thus, disruption of hepatic reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia. The data show that a substantial fraction of bilirubin conjugates is primarily secreted by MRP3 at the sinusoidal membrane into the blood, from where they are subsequently reuptaken by sinusoidal membrane-bound organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.

OATP-C, OATP2, LST-1, or SLC21A6) is a liver-specific organic anion uptake transporter and has been shown to be a higher affinity bilirubin uptake transporter than OATP1B3 In vitro OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 inhibition is associated with observations of benign clinical unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Examples of adaptive nontoxic changes in liver function, which may elevate direct (conjugated) and/or indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin above baseline levels, include reversible inhibition of UGT1A1-mediated bilirubin metabolism and OATP1B1-, OATP1B3-, or MRP2-mediated transport (Keogh. Adv Pharmacol 63:1-42, 2012).  Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic reuptake.  Bilirubin elimination is a multifaceted process consisting of uptake of bilirubin into the hepatocytes facilitated by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.  OATP1B1 polymorphism is a major determinant of serum bilirubin level but not associated with rifampicin-mediated bilirubin elevation. Unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) is taken up into hepatocytes by human organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1; encoded for by the SLCO1B1 gene). However, because drug transporters also contribute to bilirubin elimination, the purpose of this work was to investigate the in vitro inhibition of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, MRP2, and BSEP of select test drugs known to elicit hyperbilirubinemia. Test drugs investigated in this study were atazanavir and indinavir, which are associated with hyperbilirubinemia and elevations in serum transaminase; ritonavir and nelfinavir, which are not associated with hyperbilirubinemia; and bromfenac, troglitazone, and trovafloxacin, which are associated with severe idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity exhibiting elevations in serum bilirubin and transaminase.

33	53302bced6d3ac6a34000039	Does low T3 negatively affect prognosis of patients after cardiac surgery?	ur findings suggest that the development of LCOS after congenital heart surgery is associated with decreased total and free T3, and increased IL-8 levels at 48 hours, and preoperative tT4 level is an independent predictor of LCOS. Low basal fT3 concentration can reliably predict the occurrence of postoperative AF in CABG patients. A relevant finding was that the days of post-operative hospitalization (10+/-3 days, means+/-S.D.) was inversely correlated with the slope of the recovery of T3 concentration (P<0.001) or with the area under the plasma curves of T3 (P=0.024, time range 72-144 h) and the FT3/FT4 ratio (P=0.037, time range 72-144 h) during the post-operative period. 	yes
37	516c220e298dcd4e51000071	Does cucumber lower blood sugar in diabetics?	The ethanolic extract of Cucumis sativus Linn, Cucumis melo utilissimum Roxb, Cucumis melo Linn, Benincasa hispida Thunb Cogn and Tricosanthes anguina Nees, when administered in 250 mg/kg dose, orally to rats failed to lower blood sugar or to depress the peak value, after glucose load. Ethanolic extract of Tricosanthes dioica Roxb plant caused a significant lowering of blood sugar in fasted rats and depressed the peak value in glucose loaded single and longterm fed groups of rats. The ethanolic extract of the aerial part of T. dioica also induced significant depression in the peak values in the glucose loaded models. The amount of sucrose in ordinary marinated foods, such as herring, cucumber, and common beet was negligible Dietary saponins of sea cucumber ameliorate obesity, hepatic steatosis, and glucose intolerance in high-fat diet-fed mice. In this study, we investigated the effects of saponins of sea cucumber (SSC) on high-fat diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and fatty liver in mice. Mice administrated with 0.1% SSC had significantly decreased serum glucose and insulin levels, lower homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance index, and area under the blood glucose curve, suggesting that insulin sensitivity is enhanced by dietary SSC. [Effects of sea cucumber cerebroside and its long-chain base on lipid and glucose metabolism in obese mice]. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of sea cucumber cerebroside(SCC) and its long-chain base(LCB) on lipid and glucose metabolism in obese mice. CONCLUSIONS: Sea cucumber cerebroside and its long-chain base can improve the glucose and lipid metabolism in obese mice. The hitherto unknown glucose regulating role of three vegetable peels from cucurbitaceae family was evaluated. In a preliminary study, effects of ethanolic extracts of Cucurbita pepo, Cucumis sativus and Praecitrullus fistulosus peels were studied at 250 and 500 mg kg(-1) d(-1) for 15 days in the alterations in serum glucose and in hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) in male mice. All the three peel extracts nearly reversed most of these changes induced by alloxan suggesting their possible role in ameliorating diabetes mellitus and related changes in serum lipids. Antidiabetic activity of aqueous fruit extract of Cucumis trigonus Roxb. in streptozotocin-induced-diabetic rats. Cucumis trigonus Roxb. (Cucurbitaceae) fruit is used in the Indian traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes. Based on a number of reports on the blood glucose level reduction and the other complications of diabetes associated with some Cucurbitaceae plants, the antidiabetic effect of Cucumis trigonus fruit was investigated. The antidiabetic activity of aqueous extract of Cucumis trigonus fruit was evaluated by using normal and streptozotocin-induced-diabetic rats. The aqueous fruit extract of Cucumis trigonus has had beneficial effects in reducing the elevated blood glucose level and lipid profile of STZ-induced-diabetic rats. Possible amelioration of atherogenic diet induced dyslipidemia, hypothyroidism and hyperglycemia by the peel extracts of Mangifera indica, Cucumis melo and Citrullus vulgaris fruits in rats. Hitherto unknown efficacy of the peel extracts of Mangifera indica (MI), Cucumis melo (CM) and Citrullus vulgaris (CV) fruits in ameliorating the diet-induced alterations in dyslipidemia, thyroid dysfunction and diabetes mellitus have been investigated in rats. Rats, treated simultaneously with either of the peel extracts reversed the CCT-diet induced increase in the levels of tissue LPO, serum lipids, glucose, creatinine kinase-MB and decrease in the levels of thyroid hormones and insulin indicating their potential to ameliorate the diet induced alterations in serum lipids, thyroid dysfunctions and hyperglycemia/diabetes mellitus. Role of pectin from cucumber (Cucumis sativus) in modulation of protein kinase C activity and regulation of glycogen metabolism in rats. The regulatory role of protein kinase C (PKC) in glycogen metabolism in pectin fed rats was investigated. Administration of pectin (5 g/kg body wt/day) from cucumber (Cucumis sativius L.) led to inhibitory effects on PKC activity in the liver of rats. In the brain and pancreas, PKC activity was significantly higher in pectin-treated rats as compared to the control group. Level of blood glucose was significantly lowered and the level of glycogen in the liver was significantly increased in pectin-administered rats. Addition of fermented milk (yogurt) and pickled cucumber to a breakfast with a high-glycemic index bread significantly lowered postprandial glycemia and insulinemia compared with the reference meal. In contrast, addition of regular milk and fresh cucumber had no favorable effect on the metabolic responses. Tolbutamide, Cucurbita ficifolia, Phaseolus vulgaris, Opuntia streptacantha, Spinacea oleracea, Cucumis sativus and Cuminum cyminum decrease significantly the area under the glucose tolerance curve and the hyperglycemic peak. Two unsaturated fatty acids with potent α-glucosidase inhibitory activity purified from the body wall of sea cucumber (Stichopus japonicus). In this study, 2 fatty acids with strong α-glucosidase-inhibitory activity, 7(Z)-octadecenoic acid and 7(Z),10(Z)-octadecadienoic acid, were purified and identified from sea cucumber. Therefore, sea cucumber fatty acids can potentially be developed as a novel natural nutraceutical for the management of type-2 diabetes.	yes
38	5894597e7d9090f353000004	Is Annexin V an apoptotic marker?	The apoptosis of the MSCs was induced by subjecting the cells to OGD conditions for 4 h and was detected by Annexin V/PI and Hoechst 33258 staining.  In addition to the antimicrobial activity, we found that treatment of the cancer cell lines, Jurkat T-cells, Granta cells, and melanoma cells, with the Pseudomonas sp. In5 crude extract increased staining with the apoptotic marker Annexin V while no staining of healthy normal cells, i.e., naïve or activated CD4 T-cells, was observed. At the same time, the expressions of CD105, CD31, and the apoptotic marker of Annexin V were detected through flow cytometry for analyzing the relationship between the expression of cell surface markers and biological behavior. However, we found decreased sperm concentration, increase of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa and increased binding of apoptotic marker annexin V.  hCG enhanced viability of granulosa-lutein cells through antiapoptosis but not proliferation, because the apoptotic marker of annexin V was decreased, but the proliferative markers of Ki67 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen were not increased. However, as the DOTAP concentration increased from 50 to 800 microM, the apoptotic marker Annexin V and ROS double positive cells increased, suggesting that high dose of DOTAP-generated ROS causes cell apoptosis.  Expression of the apoptotic marker annexin V was unaffected by antibiotic exposure, whereas the uptake of the necrotic marker PI was increased by ofloxacin (5 mg/mL) but not by netilmicin (ofloxacin versus netilmicin, ANOVA, P<0.05). he apoptotic marker of annexin V was decreased the apoptotic marker Annexin V Annexin V labels apoptotic neurons following hypoxia-ischemia. In the present study, the apoptotic cell population was identified immunocytochemically using Annexin V, a marker of cells in an early stage of apoptosis. Use of annexin V antibody to identify apoptotic cells during pregnancy. Only few SF Treg cells were apoptotic, as indicated by limited annexin V staining of these cells. Eosinophils 'aged' in vitro for 48 h exhibited endonuclease DNA degradation, apoptotic morphology, increased red autofluorescence and externalisation of phosphatidylserine (PS) as assessed by binding of FITC-labelled annexin V. In vivo detection of apoptotic cells with fluorescently labeled annexin V is an emerging technique that we evaluated for detecting apoptotic germ cells in a mouse model of testicular torsion.Annexin V labeled with an indocyanine fluorophore (bisfunctional succinimidyl ester of cyanine 5.5) (Amersham, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) was injected intravenously in mice 18 hours after the repair of unilateral 720-degree testicular torsion for 2 hours Here, we tested the hypothesis that enhanced endothelial apoptotic microparticles and decreased endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) levels might contribute to the pathophysiology of microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria in cardiovascular disease.Flow cytometry was used to assess endothelial cell apoptosis and circulating EPC levels by quantification of circulating CD31/annexin V apoptotic microparticles and EPC markers (defined as KDRCD133, CD34CD133, CD34KDR) in peripheral blood.In total, 125 patients with hypertension were enrolled in the study, of whom 80 patients (64%) were with normoalbuminuria (albumin excretion rate of &lt;20 microg/min, overnight urine samples), 35 patients (28%) with microalbuminuria (an albumin excretion rate of 20-200 microg/min), and 10 patients (8%) with macroalbuminuria (an albumin excretion rate >200 microg/min). Surfactant protein A (SP-A) binds to phosphatidylserine and competes with annexin V binding on late apoptotic cells Targeting of apoptotic macrophages and experimental atheroma with radiolabeled annexin V: a technique with potential for noninvasive imaging of vulnerable plaque Because annexin V has a high affinity for exposed phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells, radiolabeled annexin V may be used for noninvasive detection of apoptosis in atherosclerotic lesions.Atherosclerotic plaques were produced in 5 rabbits by deendothelialization of the infradiaphragmatic aorta followed by 12 weeks of cholesterol diet; 5 controls were studied without manipulation Apoptotic abscess imaging with 99mTc-HYNIC-rh-Annexin-V. Synthesis and evaluation of a 18F-labelled recombinant annexin-V derivative, for identification and quantification of apoptotic cells with PET. Sensitive and visible detection of apoptotic cells on Annexin-V modified substrate using aminophenylboronic acid modified gold nanoparticles (APBA-GNPs) labeling. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for expression of the early apoptosis marker Annexin V and for nuclear staining by 7-aminoactinomycin (7-AAD) revealed different extents of apoptosis versus non-apoptotic cell death for the three agents. At immunofluorescence these cells contained lipid vesicles positive for the apoptotic cell marker Annexin V suggesting the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies derived from dead fat-laden hepatocytes. In this respect, we identified binding of Annexin V as an convenient marker for apoptotic cells. DR5 expression was elevated and associated with the apoptotic marker annexin V. Apoptosis was reduced in CD4(+) T cells when cultured with anti-DR5 antibody. Flow cytometric analysis using the apoptotic marker, Annexin V, shows that this endogenous re-expression is sufficient to drive the SCLC cells to apoptosis. Apoptotic cell death was evaluated by staining nuclei with propidium iodide and phosphatidylserine (a marker of early apoptotic events) with Annexin V as well as by DNA fragmentation assay. Decreased cell growth was not caused by cell death as BEL exposure did not alter nuclear morphology or increase annexin V (apoptotic cell marker) or propidium iodide (necrotic cell marker) staining after 48 h. Four populations of cells can be identified: region R1: vital cells (annexin V negative/PI negative), region R2: apoptotic cells (annexin V positive/PI negative), region R3: dead cells (annexin V positive/ PI positive); and region R4: damaged cells (annexin V negative/PI positive). Furthermore, uptake of (111)In-DTPA-PEG-annexin V by tumors correlated with apoptotic index (r = 0.87, P = 0.02). Annexin V(+)/PI(-) cells were characterized as early apoptotic, Annexin V(+)/PI(+) as late apoptotic and Annexin V(-)/PI(+) as dead. Targeting ability of Annexin V for apoptotic macrophages was kept and enhanced. [18F]annexin V accumulated in the infarct area of the left ventricle, where apoptotic cells were observed. The viability of SiHa cells was evaluated using the MTT assay, apoptosis by acridine orange/ethidium bromide, propidium iodide, TUNEL assay, and Annexin V-Cy3, cell cycle distribution and mitochondrial transmembrane potential using flow cytometry, and apoptotic marker genes using quantitative real-time PCR.  Furthermore, hesperetin-induced apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL and Annexin V-Cy3. The procedure delivers two sperm fractions: annexin V-negative (nonapoptotic) and annexin V-positive (apoptotic). The percentage of cells stained with annexin V, an early apoptotic marker, increased dramatically after cytoskeletal disruption with cytochalasin D compared with non-cytochalasin-D-treated controls (P<0.05).  Apoptotic marker Annexin V analysis showed that the apoptotic rate of NB4 cells was increased after treatment with quercetin. The cytomorphology of NB4 cells was assessed by Wright-stain, apoptosis rate by apoptotic marker Annexin V, and VEGF secretion level by ELISA.  We have coupled annexin V with the bifunctional hydrazinonicotinamide reagent (HYNIC) to prepare technetium-99m HYNIC-annexin V and demonstrated localization of radioactivity in tissues undergoing apoptosis in vivo. In conlusion, these studies confirm the value of (99m)Tc-HYNIC-annexin V uptake as a marker for the detection and quantification of apoptotic cells in vivo. The application of Annexin V labeling at electron microscopy will allow a more refined description of the morphological events occurring during apoptosis. Apoptotic cells were identified by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. 	yes

69	5a9ac4161d1251d03b000010	Does MC1R palmitoylation reduce pigmentation?	The melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R), a G-protein-coupled receptor, has a crucial role in human and mouse pigmentation. Activation of MC1R in melanocytes by α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) stimulates cAMP signalling and melanin production and enhances DNA repair after ultraviolet irradiation.  MC1R palmitoylation, primarily mediated by the protein-acyl transferase ZDHHC13, is essential for activating MC1R signalling, which triggers increased pigmentation, ultraviolet-B-induced G1-like cell cycle arrest and control of senescence and melanomagenesis in vitro and in vivo. The results highlight a central role for MC1R palmitoylation in pigmentation and protection against melanoma.	no

On November 14, 2009, he suffered from pain and edema in the right testicle that coincided with pain in the abdomen. Clinical, serological, and bacteriological investigations confirmed the first case of unilateral orchitis in man in Ecuador caused by Brucella abortus biovar 1 Brucellosis is not frequent in Chile but it may present with life threatening complications like endocarditis. Human brucellosis exhibits diverse pathological manifestations that can affect almost any organ. In particular, osteoarticular complications are the most common focal manifestation of brucellosis and occur in 40-80% of patients. Brucella. Human brucellosis often makes the diagnosis difficult. The symptoms and clinical signs most commonly reported are fever, fatigue, malaise, chills, sweats headaches, myalgia, arthralgia, and weight loss. Some cases have been presented with only joint pain, lower backache, and involuntary limb movement, burning feet, or ischemic heart attacks.  Forty-five cases were collected (31 acute and 14 sub-acute). Contamination was digestive in 62%. Symptoms of patients were fever (93%), sweating (82%), arthralgia (78%) and splenomegaly (51%). Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate was determined in 80%, leukopenia in 49% and anaemia in 37% of cases. Blood cultures were positives in 39% of cases. The four sequenced strains were identified as Brucella melitensis biovar abortus.  It is also known to cause persistent undulant fever, endocarditis, arthritis, osteomyelitis and meningitis in humans. Brucella abortus is a Gram-negative intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes a zoonosis of worldwide occurrence, leading to undulant fever in humans and abortion in domestic animals. Brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes abortion in domestic animals and undulant fever in humans. Brucella abortus is a facultative, intracellular zoonotic pathogen which can cause undulant fever in humans and abortions in cattle. Brucella abortus is a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium that causes brucellosis, a worldwide zoonotic disease leading to undulant fever in humans and abortion in cattle. Brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes abortion in domestic animals and undulant fever in humans. Brucella abortus is a gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogen that causes brucellosis, a chronic zoonotic disease resulting in abortion in pregnant cattle and undulant fever in humans. Brucella abortus is a bacterium which causes abortions and infertility in cattle and undulant fever in humans. Brucella abortus is the etiologic agent of bovine brucellosis and causes a chronic disease in humans known as undulant fever. No case of acute Brucella infection was demonstrated; however, there were 5 cases in which the serological finding was consistent with chronic brucellosis (4%). In all these cases no positive evidence of close animal contact could be found; furthermore of the 12,1% of women who actually handled domestic animals, only 1 had a history of previous abortion	no
