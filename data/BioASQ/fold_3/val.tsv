7	56bf365eef6e39474100000e	Do mutations of AKT1 occur in meningiomas?	The recent identification of somatic mutations in components of the SHH-GLI1 and AKT1-MTOR signaling pathways indicates the potential for cross talk of these pathways in the development of meningiomas. A mutation in PIK3CA or AKT1 was found in around 9 % of the cases. AKT1E17K mutations cluster with meningothelial and transitional meningiomas and can be detected by SFRP1 immunohistochemistry. AKT1E17K mutations were exclusively seen in meningiomas and occurred in 65 of 958 of these tumors. A strong preponderance was seen in the variant of meningothelial meningioma WHO grade I of basal and spinal localization. In contrast, AKT1E17K mutations were rare in WHO grade II and absent in WHO grade III meningiomas.  We observed strong up-regulation of SFRP1 expression in all meningiomas with AKT1E17K mutation and in HEK293 cells after transfection with mutant AKT1E17K, but not in meningiomas and HEK293 cells lacking this mutation. SMO and AKT1 mutations occur in non-NF2 meningiomas. Recurrent mutations in SMO and AKT1 are mutually exclusive with NF2 loss in meningioma. Genomic sequencing of meningiomas identifies oncogenic SMO and AKT1 mutations.  A subset of meningiomas lacking NF2 alterations harbored recurrent oncogenic mutations in AKT1 (p.Glu17Lys) and SMO (p.Trp535Leu) and exhibited immunohistochemical evidence of activation of these pathways. Genomic analysis of non-NF2 meningiomas reveals mutations in TRAF7, KLF4, AKT1, and SMO. A subset of meningiomas lacking NF2 alterations harbored recurrent oncogenic mutations in AKT1 (p.Glu17Lys) and SMO (p.Trp535Leu) and exhibited immunohistochemical evidence of activation of these pathways.

33	5509df4ac2af5d5b70000003	Is amiodarone a class I anti-arrhythmic drug?	Common class I agents are excluded due to the inherent abnormal cardiac structure and function in the setting of cardiogenic shock. Class III drug options include dofetilide and amiodarone. Amiodarone has been used as an anti-arrhythmic drug since the 1970s and has an established role in the treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Although considered to be a class III anti-arrhythmic, amiodarone also has class I, II and IV actions, which gives it a unique pharmacological and anti-arrhythmic profile.  Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative, introduced in 1960's as an anti-anginal agent, emerged as a potent anti-arrhythmic agent by 1970's and is currently one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in US for ventricular and atrial arrhythmias. Although amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic agent, it also has class I, II, IV actions, making it a unique and effective anti-arrhythmic agent. Amiodarone, a representative class III agent, exerts negative dromotropism by suppressing the fast sodium current responsible for conduction in acute administration (class I effects). Chronic amiodarone causes prolongation of ERP (class III effects), which is sometimes associated with negative dromotropism based on the alteration of passive or active membrane properties. Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with predominantly class III anti-arrhythmic effects, is used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Although amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic agent, it also has class I, II, IV actions, making it a unique and effective anti-arrhythmic agent Amiodarone, a class III antiarrhythmic drug, is one of the most effective drugs used in the treatment of ventricular and paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmia Although amiodarone is considered a class III anti-arrhythmic agent, it also has class I, II, IV actions, making it a unique and effective anti-arrhythmic agent Although considered to be a class III anti-arrhythmic, amiodarone also has class I, II and IV actions, which gives it a unique pharmacological and anti-arrhythmic profile Amiodarone is a potent class III anti-arrhythmic drug that also possesses beta-blocking properties	no

Two of the 259 patients (0.8%), with both follicular thyroid carcinoma and macrocephaly, were found to carry a germline mutation in the PTEN gene. The PTEN mutation frequency in unselected cases of follicular thyroid carcinoma was 4.8% The frequency of germline pathogenic PTEN mutations in an unselected series of patients with DTC is relatively low, but it is enriched by considering follicular histology and macrocephaly Similarly, there is increasing evidence demonstrating that mutations leading to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K)/AKT effectors -PTEN and PI3KCa- are essential for the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) A single male with follicular thyroid carcinoma from one of these 64 (2%) CS-like families harboured a germline point mutation, c.209T-->C Similarly, there is increasing evidence demonstrating that mutations leading to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3- kinase (PI3K)/AKT effectors -PTEN and PI3KCa- are essential for the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). The transcriptional silencing of PTEN was significantly associated with the anaplastic subtype, suggesting that PTEN is involved in the carcinogenesis of highly malignant or late-stage thyroid cancers, whereas this particular mechanism appears to be of minor importance in differentiated follicular thyroid tumors. These results show a high frequency of PTEN promoter hypermethylation, especially in follicular tumors, suggesting its possible role in thyroid tumorigenesis Our findings suggest that the PTEN tumor suppressor gene is occasionally inactivated in sporadic follicular thyroid tumors Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, which encodes a dual-specificity phosphatase, have been found in up to 80% of patients with Cowden syndrome suggesting a role of PTEN in the pathogenesis of follicular thyroid tumors The most common neoplasms in Cowden disease patients arise in the breast, skin, and thyroid (follicular subtype) The transcriptional silencing of PTEN was significantly associated with the anaplastic subtype, suggesting that PTEN is involved in the carcinogenesis of highly malignant or late-stage thyroid cancers, whereas this particular mechanism appears to be of minor importance in differentiated follicular thyroid tumors	yes

49	553cae13f32186855800000e	Is there any link between CTF4 and CTF18 during sister chromatid cohesion?	Our results suggest that Elg1, Ctf4, and Ctf18 may coordinate the relative movement of the replication fork with respect to the cohesin ring These data defined two cohesion pathways, one containing CSM3, TOF1, CTF4, and CHL1, and the second containing MRC1, CTF18, CTF8, and DCC1 Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks. The ring-shaped cohesin complex is loaded onto chromosomes before S phase in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent reaction. Cohesion establishment during DNA replication follows without further cohesin recruitment and without need for cohesin to re-engage an ATP hydrolysis motif that is critical for its initial DNA binding. This provides evidence for cohesion establishment in the context of replication forks and imposes constraints on the mechanism involved Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II In budding yeast, a specialized replication factor C called RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and the DNA-polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis We also show that, in contrast to mitosis, RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Cft8), Ctf4 and Chl1 are essential for chromosome segregation during meiosis and for the viability of meiotic products. Ctf8p is a component of Ctf18-RFC, an alternative replication factor C-like complex required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We performed synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis with a ctf8 deletion strain as a primary screen to identify other nonessential genes required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion. We then assessed proficiency of cohesion at three chromosomal loci in strains containing deletions of the genes identified in the ctf8 SGA screen. Deletion of seven genes (CHL1, CSM3, BIM1, KAR3, TOF1, CTF4, and VIK1) resulted in defective sister chromatid cohesion Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTF18 and CTF4 are required for sister chromatid cohesion CTF4 and CTF18 are required for high-fidelity chromosome segregation. Both exhibit genetic and physical ties to replication fork constituents. We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. The requirement for CTF4 and CTF18 in robust cohesion identifies novel roles for replication accessory proteins in this process Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks. Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTF18 and CTF4 are required for sister chromatid cohesion. We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. In budding yeast, a specialized replication factor C called RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and the DNA-polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II. Genetic analyses revealed that Rmi1 promoted sister chromatid cohesion in a process that was distinct from both the cohesion establishment pathway involving Ctf4, Csm3, and Chl1 and the pathway involving the acetylation of Smc3.

59	51640b4a298dcd4e51000050	Is it safe to take isotretinoin during pregnancy?	Isotretinoin is a remarkably effective drug for severe, recalcitrant acne vulgaris. a number of important adverse effects were reported even the most recent pregnancy prevention program (iPledge) is no more successful than prior programs; there will likely always be a small number of female patients becoming pregnant while receiving isotretinoin for acne vulgaris. Isotretinoin has revolutionized the management of acne vulgaris. The adverse effect(s) that led to patients stopping isotretinoin were cheilitis (22 patients), mood change (13), tiredness (12), eczema (6) and pregnancy (2). Downregulation of FGFR2b-signaling by isotretinoin explains its therapeutic effect in acne. Downregulation of FGFR2b-signaling during the first trimester of pregnancy disturbs branched morphogenesis and explains retinoid embryotoxicity. The isotretinoin, a 13-cis-retinoic acid, has revolutionized the management of severe treatment-resistant acne and it has been widely used for a range of dermatological conditions, in 90% of the time in young women between 13 and 45 years of age. This agent has severe teratogenic effects, as serious craniofacial, cardiovascular, thymic and central nervous system malformations. malformations is 3-5%, but it increases to almost 30% in women exposed to isotretinoin during the first trimester of pregnancy. Generally, patients in treatment with isotretinoin avoid eventual pregnancy during assumption and, after its stopping, fertility and foetal development are normal once circulating isotretinoin levels return to normal. After 3 months of pharmacological wash out, patient become pregnant and manifested this severe malformation. Woman interrupted gestation, by labour induction. Clindamycin phosphate 1.2% together with tretinoin 0.025% as a gel (CTG) is a topical formulation of a fixed and stable combination approved by the FDA for the treatment of acne vulgaris in patients 12 years of age or older. Safety of CTG use in pregnancy has not been established. To estimate the population-based incidence rates of pregnancy, spontaneous and elective abortions, and birth defects associated with isotretinoin use, and to determine predictors of pregnancy while on isotretinoin Pregnancies, spontaneous and elective abortions, and birth defects were identified using procedure codes and medical diagnoses. 90 women who became pregnant while on the drug, 76 terminated the pregnancy (84%), three had a spontaneous abortion (3%), two had trauma during delivery resulting in neonatal deaths (2%) and nine had a live birth (10%). Among the live births, only one had a congenital anomaly of the face and neck (11%). elective abortion rates were also much higher in our study. Topical antibiotics, isotretinoin or systemic antibiotics are usually used for acne therapy. However, isotretinoin cannot be used during pregnancy because it can cause significant birth defects while systemic antibiotics can have adverse side effects such as gastrointestinal irritation, photosensitivity and tetracycline sensitivity. Isotretinoin has been used to treat acne since 1982. Its current indications in the package insert are limited and many physicians still feel uncomfortable prescribing it because of its side effects. Aside from its teratogenic effect, isotretinoin is a safe and excellent drug for acne therapy. I a pregnancy test in females. Vitamin A and its derivatives, retinoic acid, tretinoin and isotretinoin, are currently used in dermatological treatments. The administration of high doses of this vitamin provokes congenital malformations in mice: cleft palate, maxillary and mandibular hypoplasia and total or partial fusion of the maxillary incisors. Twelve 60-day-old female Mus musculus were divided into two groups on the 7th day of pregnancy: treated group--1 mg isotretinoin per kg body weight, dissolved in vegetable oil, was administered from the 7th to the 13th day of pregnancy; control group--vegetable oil in equivalent volume was administered orally for the same period. On the 16th day of pregnancy, the females were sacrificed, the fetuses were removed and their heads amputated. The results showed that both groups had closed palates with no reminiscence of epithelial cells; however, the first molar germs of the isotretinoin-treated animals showed delayed development compared to the control animals. Isotretinoin (13-cis-RA) is teratogenic in all species examined; based on administered dose, humans appear most sensitive, followed by (in order or decreasing sensitivity) monkey, rabbit, hamster, mouse, and rat. Based on embryonic delivered dose, we suggest that 13-cis-RA is an equipotent teratogen in hamster and rabbit. its safety in humans is occasionally questioned because oral ingestion of retinoids at therapeutic levels is known to entail teratogenic risks. topical tretinoin is not a potential human developmental toxicant. Teratogenicity of vitamin A was firstly detected in experimental animals in 1953. Nearly 30 years later, teratogenicity of vitamin A analogue-isotretinoin was reported in humans. Isotretinoin induces serious birth defects of craniofacial and central nervous system, cardiovascular system and thymic malformations--in about 25% of babies exposed during the first trimester of their prenatal development. high vitamin A intake in pregnant woman: Women who use daily vitamin A supplements during early pregnancy have approximately a two-fold increased risk of giving birth to a malformed baby. Vitamin A started to affect development between doses 0.3-0.3 microm [corrected] per embryo. Malformations of head, extremities and heart were detected similarly like in laboratory mammals and in man the minimal embryotoxic doses of vitamin A in mammals were estimated to be between 0.1-1 mg/kg of maternal weight Human epidemiological studies have proved teratogenicity of vitamin A after daily doses 25,000 i.u.-8.3 mg (0.13 mg/kg)- and reduction of its maximum intake has been recommended to 10,000 i.u. per day (0.05 mg/kg). The results about teratogenicity of vitamin A achieved in the chick embryo are in agreement with such a recommendation. Intake of vitamin A in the food is sufficient for pregnant woman in common Czech population. Therefore, an artificial supplementation of vitamin A brings risk of overdosage. If supplementation by vitamin A is unavoidable during pregnancy, B-carotene should be preferred. a teratogenic dosing regimen with 13-cis-RA [Hummler et al. (1994) Teratology 50:184-193]. plasma AUC values of all-trans-RA were 2- to 7-fold higher after all-trans-RA administration (present study) than after dosing with the teratogenic dose of 13-cis-RA. These results strengthen our recent suggestion that the teratogenic effects induced in cynomolgus monkeys by 13-cis-RA treatment cannot solely result from the action of all-trans-RA, but may involve 13-cis-RA and 13-cis-4-oxo-RA, which could act directly or function as transport vehicle. VITA, among others, is involved in the process of morphogenesis. In contrast, synthetic derivatives of VITA, specifically Tigasone (etretinate, TIG) and Roaccutane (isotretinoin, ROA), are regarded as major teratogens. A biphasic maximal inhibition was present at 1 microM concentrations when the retinoids VITA, TIG and ROA were added for 16 h (52, 58 and 57%, respectively; P < 0.01 by one-way analysis of variance). In contrast, the addition of the three retinoids at 1 microM concentrations for 16 h had no significant effect on HCG secretion by placental explants of 11-13 weeks gestational age. Inhibition of HCG secretion by retinoids may contribute either directly or indirectly to their teratogenicity. Isotretinoin is a potent retinoic acid used in the treatment of skin disorders. Though very effective, it is teratogenic if administered during pregnancy, and its teratogenic effect may be related to the normal activity of retinoids as signalling molecules in the embryo. defects that includes heart defects, by inhibiting the migration of neural crest cells. Proliferation in heart tissue of whole embryo cultures was inhibited in medium with 10(-6) M isotretinoin to 62% of the control level in myocardium. The results suggest multiple effects of retinoids on growth, morphogenesis, and differentiation of early cardiac tissue, and are discussed in relation to the potential role of retinoids in early embryogenesis. Oral administration of 400 mg/kg of 13-cis retinoic acid to 9 day pregnant mice gives rise to important maxillofacial malformations. The first manifestation of teratogenic effect is an increase of density of cell death arising in the dorsal part of the first two branchial arches at day 9.5. These two arches become hypoplastic at days 10 and 11, and the preskeletal anlagen appear too late in comparison to control embryos. Meckel's cartilage is too curvilinear and medially situated. Pre-ossicular and pre-mandibular blastemata develop with spatial distortions which are well analyzable at days 16 and 17 Isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid, Accutane) increases the risk of major congenital malformations in infants exposed to isotretinoin during pregnancy. However, there have been no epidemiologic reports to date on the effect of a subsequent pregnancy after discontinuation of isotretinoin. analysis of pregnancy case reports from patients in whom conception occurred after isotretinoin treatment had been discontinued spontaneous and missed abortions from all pregnancies was 9.1% (eight patients), and the incidence rate of congenital malformation among the live births was 5.0% (four patients). were not significantly different from the rates reported for women of reproductive age in the general population. In addition, the malformations reported were not characteristic of retinoic acid-induced congenital anomalies. Keratolenticular dysgenesis (Peters' anomaly) was induced in mice by exposure to the human teratogens, ethanol or 13-cis retinoic acid (isotretinoin, Accutane). Acute teratogen exposure on the seventh day of gestation (corresponding to the third week of human gestation) resulted in an eye malformation incidence of 46% to 100% in day 14 fetuses This secondary effect on neural crest derivatives is exhibited in the adult animals as corneal opacities associated with defects in Descemet's membrane and endothelium, and anterior polar cataracts. 13-cis-retinoic acid (13-cis-RA, or isotretinoin) is responsible for various craniofacial malformations in the rodent and human embryo. In whole embryo culture, 13-cis-RA caused significant overall embryonic growth retardation, especially in the primary and secondary palatal processes. subsequent cell growth was decreased at concentrations of 13-cis-RA greater than 1 X 10(-5) M. After a 40-hr treatment period, labeling indices in retinoid-treated cells were significantly lower than control values (25% compared with 40%). Retinoic acid also caused a significant, concentration-dependent decrease in 3H-thymidine incorporation. The inhibitory effect of 13-cis-RA on proliferation of oral-nasal mesenchymal cells appears to be related to the production of craniofacial malformations. Reports of adverse human pregnancy outcomes including cleft palate have increased as the clinical use of isotretinoin (13-cis-retinoic acid) and other retinoic acid (RA) derivatives have increased, but the mechanisms by which their effects are exerted are not understood. In shelves exposed to EGF and trans-RA early in their development, DNA synthesis appears to terminate prematurely as compared to shelves cultured in control media, and this effect is accompanied by excessive mesenchymal extracellular space expansion. Exposure of shelves to EGF alone is sufficient to block degeneration and induce hyperplasia of the medial epithelial cells but does not induce other ultrastructural changes seen with both EGF and RA. The observed alterations in medial cell morphology could interfere with adhesion of the palatal shelves and may play a role in retinoid-induced cleft palate in the human embryo. Recent clinical observations strongly suggest that isotretinoin [13-cis-retinoic acid (cis RA)] is a human teratogen causing primarily heart and craniofacial malformations including ear and palatal defects. Our results demonstrate that labeled cis RA enters the tissues of the embryo both in vivo and in vitro. Cis RA inhibited proliferation of the frontonasal mesenchyme cells in primary culture with 31% inhibition occurring at 2 X 10(-5) M cis RA. Retinoic acid, an analogue of vitamin A, is known to be teratogenic in laboratory animals and has recently been implicated in a few clinical case reports. To study the human teratogenicity of this agent, we investigated 154 human pregnancies with fetal exposure to isotretinoin, a retinoid prescribed for severe recalcitrant cystic acne. The outcomes were 95 elective abortions, 26 infants without major malformations, 12 spontaneous abortions, and 21 malformed infants. A subset of 36 of the 154 pregnancies was observed prospectively. Exposure to isotretinoin was associated with an unusually high relative risk for a group of selected major malformations (relative risk = 25.6; 95 per cent confidence interval, 11.4 to 57.5). It is possible that a major mechanism of isotretinoin teratogenesis is a deleterious effect on cephalic neural-crest cell activity that results in the observed craniofacial, cardiac, and thymic malformations.	no

101	530cefaaad0bf1360c000008	Is lambrolizumab effective for treatment of patients with melanoma ?	"However, through parallel efforts that have showcased the efficacy of small-molecule BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors, as well as the immune checkpoint inhibitors, namely ipilimumab and the anti-PD1/PDL1 antibodies (lambrolizumab, nivolumab, MPDL3280), an opportunity exists to transform the treatment of melanoma specifically and cancer generally by exploring rational combinations of molecularly targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and molecular targeted therapies with immunotherapies.  Programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1)/its ligand (PD-L1) antibodies have changed the landscape in oncology in 2013. The most mature results have been obtained in advanced melanoma patients.  Merck's lambrolizumab (MK-3475) monoclonal antibody received ""Breakthrough Therapy"" designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April for treating patients with advanced melanoma. The programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell effector mechanisms that limits immune responses against cancer. We tested the anti-PD-1 antibody lambrolizumab (previously known as MK-3475) in patients with advanced melanoma.  In patients with advanced melanoma, including those who had had disease progression while they had been receiving ipilimumab, treatment with lambrolizumab resulted in a high rate of sustained tumor regression, with mainly grade 1 or 2 toxic effects.  Because of all these reasons PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies are considered 'drug of the year'."	yes
103	56c048e2ef6e39474100001d	Is nintedanib effective for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis?	In this review, we present the positive results of recently published clinical trials regarding therapy for IPF, with emphasis on pirfenidone and nintedanib. Nintedanib: evidence for its therapeutic potential in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  In the Phase II TOMORROW trial, treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily showed a trend to slow the decline in lung function and significantly decrease acute exacerbations in patients with IPF, while showing an acceptable safety profile. The Phase III INPULSIS trials demonstrated a significant decrease in the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity in IPF patients treated with 150 mg nintedanib twice daily. In the INPULSIS-2 trial, the time to the first acute exacerbation significantly increased in IPF patients who were treated with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily.  Effects on collagen secretion were compared with those of the drugs nintedanib and pirfenidone, recently approved for IPF. Nintedanib, an orally available, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with selectivity for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors has recently been shown, in two pivotal phase III studies, to effectively slow IPF disease progression. Consequently, nintedanib was given accelerated approval by the FDA in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF.  Most recently, pirfenidone and nintedanib, two compounds with pleiotropic anti-fibrotic properties, have been proven effective in reducing functional decline and disease progression in IPF.  Meningococcal group B vaccine (Trumenba) to prevent more types of invasive meningococcal disease; antihemophilic factor (recombinant), porcine sequence (Obizur) to treat bleeding from acquired hemophilia A; and pirfenidone (Esbriet) and nintedanib (Ofev) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  More importantly, the period ends with the publication of two groundbreaking studies that confirmed that two drugs, pirfenidone and nintedanib, slowed disease progression, leading to a historic approval by the FDA.  Nintedanib (Ofev(®)) is an orally available, small, multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed by Boehringer Ingelheim for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and cancer. Nintedanib received its first global approval in the US in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF. Nintedanib has received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the treatment of IPF, and for the second-line treatment in combination with docetaxel of locally advanced, metastatic or locally recurrent non-small cell lung cancer of adenocarcinoma tumour histology.  This article summarizes the milestones in the development of nintedanib leading to this first approval for IPF. Efficacy and safety of nintedanib in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib: a novel therapeutic approach for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Nintedanib is in clinical development as a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Reducing lung function decline in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: potential of nintedanib. These results suggest that nintedanib may impact the progressive course of fibrotic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Findings from recently published placebo-controlled trials in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have established that pirfenidone and nintedanib prevent about 50% of the decline in forced vital capacity typically seen in this disease; future trials are therefore unlikely to use placebo as a control group for ethical reasons. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib (BIBF 1120) is in clinical development for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.  Data from the Phase II TOMORROW study suggested that nintedanib 150�mg twice daily had clinical benefits with an acceptable safety profile.METHODS: The INPULSIS� trials are replicate Phase III, randomized, double-blind, studies comparing the efficacy and safety of nintedanib 150�mg twice daily with placebo in patients with IPF.  Nintedanib received its first global approval in the US in October 2014 for the treatment of IPF.  The most frequent adverse event in the nintedanib groups was diarrhea, with rates of 61.5% and 18.6% in the nintedanib and placebo groups, respectively, in INPULSIS-1 and 63.2% and 18.3% in the two groups, respectively, in INPULSIS-2. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, nintedanib reduced the decline in FVC, which is consistent with a slowing of disease progression; nintedanib was frequently associated with diarrhea, which led to discontinuation of the study medication in less than 5% of patients.  A phase 2 trial suggested that treatment with 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily reduced lung-function decline and acute exacerbations in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: We conducted two replicate 52-week, randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trials (INPULSIS-1 and INPULSIS-2) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 150 mg of nintedanib twice daily as compared with placebo in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

118	54cf48acf693c3b16b00000b	Is progesterone effective for treatment of patients with traumatic brain injury based on clinical trial data?	BACKGROUND: Progesterone has been associated with robust positive effects in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and with clinical benefits in two phase 2 randomized, controlled trials.  The proportion of patients with a favorable outcome on the Glasgow Outcome Scale (good recovery or moderate disability) was 50.4% with progesterone, as compared with 50.5% with placebo. Mortality was similar in the two groups. No relevant safety differences were noted between progesterone and placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Primary and secondary efficacy analyses showed no clinical benefit of progesterone in patients with severe TBI. These data stand in contrast to the robust preclinical data and results of early single-center trials that provided the impetus to initiate phase 3 trials. BACKGROUND: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Progesterone has been shown to improve neurologic outcome in multiple experimental models and two early-phase trials involving patients with TBI.  There was no significant difference between the progesterone group and the placebo group in the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome (relative benefit of progesterone, 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85 to 1.06; P=0.35). Phlebitis or thrombophlebitis was more frequent in the progesterone group than in the placebo group (relative risk, 3.03; CI, 1.96 to 4.66).  CONCLUSIONS: This clinical trial did not show a benefit of progesterone over placebo in the improvement of outcomes in patients with acute TBI.  Numerous studies, however, show that progesterone has substantial pleiotropic properties as a neuroprotective agent in both animal models and humans. RESULTS: There was a better recovery rate and GOS score for the patients who were given progesterone than for those in the control group in a 3-months follow-up period (50% vs. 21%); subgroup analysis showed a significant difference in the percentage of favorable outcome between the two groups with GCS of 5-8 (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The use of progesterone may significantly improve neurologic outcome of patients suffering severe TBI up to 3 months after injury, especially those with 5≤GCS≤8, providing a potential benefit to the treatment of acute severe TBI patients. Considering this drug had no significant side effects, so progesterone could be used in patients with severe TBI as a neuro-protective drug. While progesterone and ciclosporin have shown promise in phase II studies, success in larger phase III, randomized, multicentre, clinical trials is pending.  All three studies reported the effects of progesterone on mortality. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for mortality at end of follow-up was 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.93. Three studies measured disability and found the RR of death or severe disability in patients treated with progesterone to be 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical evidence from three small RCTs indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering TBI. This evidence is still insufficient and further multicentre randomised controlled trials are required. GOS was classified to 2 main categories of favorable and unfavorable recovery, of which, favorable recovery in placebo, progesterone, and progesterone-vitamin D was 25%, 45%, and 60%, respectively which showed a statistical significant difference among the groups (P-value = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The results showed that recovery rate in patients with severe brain trauma in the group receiving progesterone and vitamin D together was significantly higher than that of progesterone group, which was in turn higher than that of placebo group.  The pooled relative risk (RR) for mortality at end of follow-up is 0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.93. Three studies measured disability and found the RR of death or severe disability in patients treated with progesterone was 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.96. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Current clinical evidence from three small RCTs indicates progesterone may improve the neurologic outcome of patients suffering TBI. This evidence is still insufficient and further multicentre randomised controlled trials are required. Clinical trials have shown that short-and long-term progesterone treatment induces a significant improvement in the level of disability among patients with brain injury.  Improved outcomes from the administration of progesterone for patients with acute severe traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that acute severe TBI patients with administration of progesterone hold improved neurologic outcomes for up to 6 months. These results provide information important for further large and multicenter clinical trials on progesterone as a promising neuroprotective drug.  The modified Functional Independence Measure scores in the progesterone group were higher than those in the placebo group at both 3-month and 6-month follow-up (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01). The mortality rate of the progesterone group was significantly lower than that of the placebo group at 6-month follow-up (P < 0.05).  CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that acute severe TBI patients with administration of progesterone hold improved neurologic outcomes for up to 6 months. These results provide information important for further large and multicenter clinical trials on progesterone as a promising neuroprotective drug.  These data, combined with the results of the previously published ProTECT trial, show progesterone to be safe and potentially efficacious in the treatment of TBI. Larger phase III trials will be necessary to verify results prior to clinical implementation. CONCLUSION: It indicated that successive early application of PG will benefit the patients with acute severe head injury by improving the recovery and reducing the disability, which may be related to its alleviating inflammatory and lipid peroxidation response. Adverse and serious adverse event rates were similar in both groups, except that patients randomized to progesterone had a lower 30-day mortality rate than controls (rate ratio 0.43; 95% confidence interval 0.18 to 0.99).  However, moderate traumatic brain injury survivors who received progesterone were more likely to have a moderate to good outcome than those randomized to placebo. CONCLUSION: In this small study, progesterone caused no discernible harm and showed possible signs of benefit. After more than 30 years of research and 30 failed clinical trials with as many different treatments, progesterone is the first agent to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy as a treatment for traumatic brain injuries. After more than 30 years of research and 30 failed clinical trials with as many different treatments, progesterone is the first agent to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy as a treatment for traumatic brain injuries A US National Institutes of Health-sponsored, nationwide Phase III clinical trial is now evaluating progesterone for moderate-to-severe TBI in 1200 patients An industry-sponsored Phase III international trial is also under way, and planning for a trial using progesterone to treat pediatric brain injury has begun More than two decades of pre-clinical research and two recent clinical trials have shown that progesterone (PROG) and its metabolites exert beneficial effects after traumatic brain injury (TBI) through a number of metabolic and physiological pathways that can reduce damage in many different tissues and organ systems After more than 30 years of research and 30 failed clinical trials with as many different treatments, progesterone is the first agent to demonstrate robust clinical efficacy as a treatment for traumatic brain injuries RESULTS: Analysis of these reviews yielded meanfuling observations: (1) The effectiveness of most ordinary treatments in TBI is inconclusive except that corticosteroids are likely to be ineffective or harmful, and tranexamic acid, nimodipine and progesterone show a promising effect in bleeding trauma, traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, TBI or severe TBI. Laboratory data strongly show that progesterone treatment after TBI reduces edema, improves outcomes, and restores blood-brain barrier function. Clinical studies to date agree with these data, and there are ongoing human trials for progesterone treatment after TBI.	no
123	52b2ecd34003448f55000003	Have mutations in the GARS gene been identified to cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 2D (CMT2D)?	Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D is a hereditary axonal and glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS)-associated neuropathy that is caused by a mutation in GARS.  Mutations in the GARS gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2D and distal spinal muscular atrophy type V - allelic disorders characterized by predominantly distal upper extremity weakness and atrophy, typically beginning during the second decade of life.  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D) is a dominantly inherited peripheral neuropathy caused by missense mutations in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase gene (GARS). The 13 genes known to be associated with the CMT2 subtypes are KIF1B (CMT2A1), MFN2 (CMT2A2), RAB7A (formerly RAB7) (CMT2B), LMNA (CMT2B1), MED25 (CMT2B2), TRPV4 (CMTC), GARS (CMT2D), NEFL (CMT2E/1F), HSPB1 (CMT2F), MPZ (CMT2I/J), GDAP1 (CMT2H/K), HSPB8 (CMT2L), and AARS (CMT2N).   The diagnosis of GARS-associated axonal neuropathy is based on clinical findings, electromyography (EMG), and molecular genetic testing of GARS, encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase. Sporadic juvenile muscular atrophy of the distal upper extremity or Hirayama's disease (HD) and autosomal dominant motor distal neuronopathy/axonopathy (CMT2D/dSMA-V), produced by glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene mutations, share some clinical features including: young age of onset, predilection for the distal upper extremity, asymmetry, sparing of proximal muscles and unusual cold sensitivity.  Distal hereditary motor neuropathy type V (dHMN-V) and Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) type 2 presenting with predominant hand involvement, also known as CMT2D and Silver syndrome (SS) are rare phenotypically overlapping diseases which can be caused by mutations in the Berardinelli-Seip Congenital Lipodystrophy 2 (BSCL2) and in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase encoding (GARS) genes.  We previously implicated mutations in the gene encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) as the cause of CMT2D and dSMA-V. Of the many inherited Charcot-Marie-Tooth peripheral neuropathies, type 2D (CMT2D) is caused by dominant point mutations in the gene GARS, encoding glycyl tRNA synthetase (GlyRS).  Missense mutations in the glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) gene have been recently reported in families with either dHMN-V, CMT2D, or both. Based on the presence or absence of sensory changes, the disease phenotype was initially defined as distal spinal muscular atrophy type V (dSMA-V) in three families, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D) in a single family, and as either dSMA-V or CMT2D in patients of another large family. Linkage to chromosome 7p15 and the presence of disease-associated heterozygous GARS mutations have been identified in patients from each of the five studied families. 	yes
124	515df6f2298dcd4e5100002d	Does melanoma  occur in people of African origin ?	ALM is the most common type of melanoma amongst Asians, Africans, ALM develops on palmar, plantar, and subungual skin, and its biology is different from that of other cutaneous melanomas, where sunlight is the major known environmental determinant We present four albinos with histologic diagnoses of skin cancer Four Nigerian albinos (two men and two women) with skin cancer The sites of the lesions included the head [squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in two patients and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in one patient] and the upper limb (melanoma wenty-nine patients (18 males and 11 females) with skin cancer were identified Kaposi sarcoma associated with HIV represented 81.8 percent of KS cases found. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) ranked second and malignant melanoma third Earlier studies have shown frequent mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes in cutaneous melanoma, but these alterations have not been examined in the rare category of melanoma from black Africans. In a series of melanomas from black Africans (n=26), only two BRAF mutations (8%) were found, both being different from the common T1799A substitution. Moreover, melanomas from black Africans exhibited mutations in NRAS exon 1 only (12%), whereas NRAS exon 2 mutations were predominant in melanomas from Caucasians. Thus, the frequencies of BRAF and NRAS mutations were particularly low in melanomas from black Africans, supporting a different pathogenesis of these tumors. Malignant melanoma (MM) remains a pediatric rarity world-wide, but perhaps more so in black Africans. To the best of our knowledge, the current report of MM in a two-and-a-half-year-old Nigerian who had a pre-existing congenital giant hairy nevus is probably the first (in an accessible literature) in a black African child. Malignant melanomas in black Africans are predominantly located on the lower extremities Thus, our findings indicate that melanomas located on the lower extremities in black Africans show several features of aggressiveness; in particular, the proliferative activity was high, and p16 alterations was frequent as evidenced by loss of protein staining. Our findings also indicated that the diagnosis is delayed among black Africans. Africans with dark skin have a reduced risk of getting all types of skin cancer as compared with Caucasians, but the ratio of their incidence rates of cutaneous malignant melanoma to that of squamous cell carcinoma is larger than the corresponding ratio for Caucasians. ( Albino Africans, as compared with normally pigmented Africans, seem to have a relatively small risk of getting cutaneous malignant melanomas compared to nonmelanomas. This is probably also true for albino and normally pigmented Caucasians. Scant data exists on melanoma in blacks from Africa The mean age at presentation of the 39 women and 24 men was 60.5 years (range of 30 to 85 years), with a peak incidence in the sixth decade. The foot was the most common site of disease (45 patients). Seven patients had subungual melanoma, seven had primary mucosal lesions, and in six, the primary lesion could not be found. The poor prognosis in black patients in South Africa is the result of delayed presentation with thick primary lesions and advanced disease The outcome of treatment in 40 black patients (27 women, 13 men; mean age 62.9 years) with plantar melanoma over a 13-year period was analysed Delay in presentation and locally advanced disease may explain the poor prognosis of plantar melanoma in black South Africans. Eighteen cases of malignant skin tumors seen at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital over 3 years (1984 to 1987) were analyzed for diagnoses, site of tumors, sex, and age. Seven patients (39%) had malignant melanomas affecting only the soles of the feet, while the same number had squamous cell carcinomas widely distributed in various parts of the body Non-white populations experienced in general a much lower incidence of melanoma although there was some overlap of white and non-white rates. Populations of African descent were found to have a higher incidence than those of Asiatic origin, but it was concluded that this was due largely to the high frequency of tumours among Africans on the sole of the foot. Pathological features of twenty-one cases of malignant melanoma studied in the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu during the period January, 1974 to December, 1975 are presented. Malignant melanoma accounted for 2.4% of all tumours and 4.5% of all malignant tumours, greatest age incidence being in the fifth to seventh decades. 81% melanomas occurred on the sole of feet validating the hypothesis that the pigmented skin in Africans is resistant to malignant melanoma. This paper reports the incidence of this lesion in association with invasive malignant melanomas of the feet and hands of Black Africans. Follow-up data (over a 3-year period) and the histological appearances of primary lesion were studied and related in 40 Black patients with malignant melanoma. Malignant melanoma of the skin in Blacks in formidable and sinister tumour. The incidence of malignant melanoma in Johannesburg Black was 1,2 per 100 000 and accounted for 2% of all cancers. The largest number of cases occurred in the 50- 70-year age group and there was a female preponderance. As in previous studies, the sites predominantly affected were the foot and the hand, mainly on the plantar and palmar surfaces. Twenty-one cases of malignant melanoma occurring in the Igbos of Nigeria have been analysed. The site of predilection is the sole of the foot. This result supports the conclusion that Negroes tend to have the disease in the non-pigmented parts. A case of leptomeningeal melanoma in an African child of 7 years is presented together with a survey of pigmentation in the normal African brain.	yes

Differential carbonylation of cytoskeletal proteins in blood group O erythrocytes: potential role in protection against severe malaria. . Our findings indicate a possible correlation between the protection against severe malaria in blood group O individuals and a specific pattern of 4-HNE-carbonylation of cytoskeleton proteins. There is a predominance of blood group O in malaria-endemic regions, and several lines of evidence suggest that ABO blood groups may influence the outcome of P. falciparum infection These data provide the first evidence that ABO blood group antigens influence macrophage clearance of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and suggest an additional mechanism by which blood group O may confer resistance to severe malaria. Blood group phenotypes A and B are risk factors for cerebral malaria in Odisha, India. type O is significantly associated with protection against CM, patients with type A and B group had increased risk for developing CM. Blood group O protects against severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria through the mechanism of reduced rosetting. Malaria has been a major selective force on the human population, and several erythrocyte polymorphisms have evolved that confer resistance to severe malaria. Plasmodium falciparum rosetting, a parasite virulence phenotype associated with severe malaria, is reduced in blood group O erythrocytes compared with groups A, B, and AB, but the contribution of the ABO blood group system to protection against severe malaria has received little attention We hypothesized that blood group O may confer resistance to severe falciparum malaria through the mechanism of reduced rosetting. It appears that individuals who are of blood-group O are relatively resistant to the severe disease caused by P. falciparum infection.	yes

Alpers syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive hepatocerebral degenerative disorder. Alpers disease is a recessive mitochondrial disorder caused by mutations in POLG1 and characterized primarily by progressive neurological and hepatic degeneration. Alpers syndrome is an autosomal recessive mitochondrial DNA depletion disorder that affects children and young adults. We conclude that Alpers disease can be a cause of rapidly progressive liver failure in early childhood. Although the cause of this autosomal recessive disease is not known, it does not appear to be related to peroxisomal dysfunction.	yes

198	5148e42cd24251bc0500003b	Can PLN mutations lead to dilated cardiomyopathy?	A PLN founder mutation (43 cases) and LMNA mutations (19 cases, 16 different mutations) were most prevalent and often demonstrated a specific phenotype. PLN mutation R14del was identified in 12 (12 %) ARVC patients and in 39 (15 %) DCM patients The PLN R14del founder mutation is present in a substantial number of patients clinically diagnosed with DCM or ARVC Arg(9) → Cys (R9C) and Arg(14) deletion (R14del) mutations in PLN are associated with lethal dilated cardiomyopathy in humans We previously reported the deletion of the highly conserved amino acid residue arginine 14 (nucleic acids 39, 40 and 41) in DCM patients. Mutations in the gene encoding PLN have been associated with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; Mutations in the PLN gene are a rare cause of heart failure, present almost exclusively in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy etiology A missense mutation in PLN cytoplasmic domain (R9C) triggers dilated cardiomyopathy in humans, leading to premature death. Complete genetic and clinical analyses were performed in a family with familial dilated cardiomyopathy due to the PLN-R14Del mutation. A candidate gene approach resulted in identification of a heterozygous deletion of arginine 14 in the gene encoding phospholamban (PLN-R14Del) segregating with dilated cardiomyopathy in the family pedigree. Mutation carriers suffered from familial dilated cardiomyopathy associated with cardiac death between the ages of 26 and 50 years. a family with familial dilated cardiomyopathy due to the PLN-R14Del mutation. For the phospholamban (PLN) and titin cap (TTN) genes, a direct mutation screening approach was used. DNA sequence analysis of all exons showed no evidence that these genes are involved in DCM in the Newfoundland dog. two human PLN mutations, associated with either absence or sustained dephosphorylation of PLN, were linked to dilated cardiomyopathy. Mutations in the gene encoding PLN have been associated with dilated cardiomyopathy characterized by early onset and the presence of lethal ventricular arrhythmias. The identical PLN mutation can be associated with both mild and severe forms of dilated cardiomyopathy. Additionally, PLN mutations should be considered in late onset cardiomyopathy Through genetic screening of dilated cardiomyopathy patients, we identified a previously uncharacterized deletion of arginine 14 (PLN-R14Del) in the coding region of the phospholamban (PLN) gene in a large family with hereditary heart failure. No PLN gene mutation was found in patients with DCM in Chengdu. This result indicated that PLN gene mutation may not be a common cause for DCM in the Chinese population in Chengdu. none in PLN the recent discoveries of human PLN mutations leading to disease states. Strikingly, both individuals homozygous for L39stop developed dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, requiring cardiac transplantation at ages 16 and 27. humans lacking PLN develop lethal dilated cardiomyopathy. Here we report that an inherited human dilated cardiomyopathy with refractory congestive heart failure is caused by a dominant Arg --> Cys missense mutation at residue 9 (R9C) in phospholamban (PLN)	yes
223	5544f3005beec11c10000008	Is transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) related to gene expression levels?	"These mutations were frequent in plasmid-borne lacS expressed at a high level but not in single-copy lacS in the chromosome or at lower levels of expression in a plasmid. The results suggest that important DNA repair or replication fidelity functions are impaired or overwhelmed in pJlacS, with results analogous to those of the ""transcription-associated mutagenesis"" seen in bacteria and eukaryotes. the rate of point mutation in a gene increases with the expression level of the gene. Transcription induces mutagenesis on both DNA strands, indicating simultaneous actions of several TAM mechanisms. High-levels of transcription through a gene stimulate spontaneous mutation rate, a phenomenon termed transcription-associated mutation (TAM). High levels of transcription in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are associated with increased genetic instability, which has been linked to DNA damage. Here, we describe a pGAL-CAN1 forward mutation assay for studying transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) in yeast. The acquisition of mutations was directly correlated to the level of transcription Our results demonstrate that the level of Leu(+) reversions increased significantly in parallel with the induced increase in transcription levels. Transcription-associated mutagenesis in yeast is directly proportional to the level of gene expression spontaneous mutation rate is directly proportional to the transcription level, suggesting that movement of RNA polymerase through the target initiates a mutagenic process(es) High transcription is associated with genetic instability, notably increased spontaneous mutation rates, which is a phenomenon termed Transcription-Associated-Mutagenesis (TAM).

224	514a1469d24251bc05000056	Is there a pharmacogenetic test for trastuzumab?	The clinical need for novel approaches to improve drug therapy derives from the high rate of adverse reactions to drugs and their lack of efficacy in many individuals that may be predicted by pharmacogenetic testing. the assessment of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER-2) expression for trastuzumab therapy of breast cancer HER2 positive breast cancer and the use of the drug Herceptin The dependence on gene copy number or expression levels of HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for therapeutic efficacy of trastuzumab and cetuximab (Erbitux), respectively, supports the importance of selecting suitable patient populations based on their pharmacogenetic profile. to explore informed consent issues surrounding the use of the drug Herceptin, widely cited as an example of a novel approach to drug development called pharmacogenetics. Drawing on qualitative semi-structured interviews with 25 UK-based breast cancer specialists, this paper explores Herceptin's disputed epistemological status, as an example of pharmacogenetics or as something out of the ordinary in terms of clinical practice. There have been several success stories in the field of pharmacogenetics in recent years, including the analysis of HER2 amplification for trastuzumab selection in breast cancer Trastuzumab is standard of care in the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2⁺ early and advanced breast cancer. HER-2 overexpression as a predictor of response to trastuzumab Pharmacogenomic analysis aspires to identify individuals with specific genetic characteristics in order to predict a positive response or reduce a negative response to a therapeutic modality. Assays are available to detect the HER2 protein receptor or copies of the HER2 gene sequence to determine eligibility for Herceptin treatment or adriamycin treatment in node positive patients, respectively. Determining the HER2 status of breast carcinomas is a prerequisite for the use of the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin), which has recently been licensed for the treatment of metastatic disease. Laboratory testing of HER2/neu in breast carcinoma has become vital to patient care following the approval of trastuzumab as the first therapy to target the HER2/neu oncoprotein. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was performed with use of a diagnostic test for the assessment of HER2 overexpression, the HercepTest. To test for HER-2/neu overexpression in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the possible role of the recombinant monoclonal anti-HER-2/neu antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. To evaluate concordance between local and central laboratory HER2 testing results in patients from the North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) N9831 adjuvant trial of trastuzumab. These findings support the importance of using high-volume, experienced laboratories for HER2 testing to improve the process of selecting patients likely to benefit from trastuzumab therapy. we measured trastuzumab levels in the serum and in cerebrospinal fluid of metastatic breast cancer patients with brain metastases receiving trastuzumab for HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. In a pilot study, metastatic breast cancer patients with brain metastases and HER2-overexpressing tumors (HercepTest; Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) were included. Monitoring of trastuzumab levels in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid may enable individualized therapy strategies in metastatic breast cancer patients with brain metastases, and lead to a better understanding of trastuzumab pharmacokinetics in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum. Biotin-labeled trastuzumab (BiotHER) can be used to test for HER2 by immunohistochemistry. The results support a role for BiotHER testing in better tailoring trastuzumab-based treatments in patients with advanced HER2-amplified breast cancers. response to anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapy trastuzumab.	yes
228	5713c7dd1174fb1755000014	Have C12orf65 mutations been associated with axonal neuropathy and optic atrophy?	Novel C12orf65 mutations in patients with axonal neuropathy and optic atrophy Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) forms a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of disorders. Although a number of disease genes have been identified for CMT, the gene discovery for some complex form of CMT has lagged behind. The association of neuropathy and optic atrophy (also known as CMT type 6) has been described with autosomaldominant, recessive and X-linked modes of inheritance. Mutations in Mitofusin 2 have been found to cause dominant forms of CMT6. Phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase-I mutations cause X-linked CMT6, but until now, mutations in the recessive forms of disease have never been identified.METHODS: We here describe a family with three affected individuals who inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion a childhood onset neuropathy and optic atrophy. Using homozygosity mapping in the family and exome sequencing in two affected individuals we identified a novel protein-truncating mutation in the C12orf65 gene, which encodes for a protein involved in mitochondrial translation Novel C12orf65 mutations in patients with axonal neuropathy and optic atrophy. Our study broadens the phenotypic spectrum of C12orf65 defects and highlights the triad of optic atrophy, axonal neuropathy and spastic paraparesis as its key clinical features. C12orf65 participates in the process of mitochondrial translation and has been shown to be associated with a spectrum of phenotypes, including early onset optic atrophy, progressive encephalomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and spastic paraparesis.We used whole-genome homozygosity mapping as well as exome sequencing and targeted gene sequencing to identify novel C12orf65 disease-causing mutations in seven affected individuals originating from two consanguineous families.

Optic atrophy and a Leigh-like syndrome due to mutations in the c12orf65 gene: report of a novel mutation and review of the literature. Recently, we identified the causative gene, C12orf65, that was reported the gene for Leigh syndrome, for autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia with optic atrophy and neuropathy (SPG55). We describe 2 siblings with compound heterozygous mutations in the recently identified C12orf65 gene who presented with optic atrophy and mild developmental delays and subsequently developed bilateral, symmetric lesions in the brainstem reminiscent of Leigh syndrome.

229	550bf315c2af5d5b7000000e	Is cystatin C or cystatin 3 used as a biomarker of kidney function?	to explore the effect of ageing on renal function with cystatin C as the marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the general population without vascular disease or diabetes. Cystatin C, a more specific kidney function biomarker, was also elevated at 24 h after CLP. This study evaluated FGF-23 as well as traditional markers of kidney disease, namely urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) and creatinine-cystatin C estimated GFR (eGFRCrCyC), as risk factors for AKI in elderly individuals.  he primary predictor was estimated GFR (eGFR) calculated using serum cystatin C (eGFR(cys)). A number of recent reports have suggested that the cystatin C/creatinine (CysC/Cr) ratio might be a useful biomarker of renal function in pediatric patients. The CKD-EPI equation using cystatin C was the most precise method of renal function evaluation in patients with neurogenic bladder. Serum cystatin C (CysC) is an endogenous marker of kidney function. The urinary content of CysC reflects tubular epithelial dysfunction whereas that of NGAL also characterizes tubular atrophy. Estimated kidney function based on serum cystatin C  : Several formulas for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) estimation, based on serum creatinine or cystatin C, have been proposed.  he highest and lowest eGFR levels corresponded to the cystatin C-based and MDRD-4 equations, respectively.  The Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) recently proposed an equation to estimate GFR in subjects without cirrhosis using both serum creatinine and cystatin C levels. Emerging evidence has shown that cystatin C may improve classification of glomerular filtration rate for defining chronic kidney disease in certain clinical populations and assist in understanding the complications of chronic kidney disease Beta-trace protein (BTP) and cystatin C (CysC) are novel biomarkers of renal function.  Cystatin C could improve chronic kidney disease (CKD) classification in HIV-infected women relative to serum creatinine.  Iohexol clearance and cystatin C formulae identify a greater proportion of patients with a GFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), which also predicts the development of AKI.  Cystatin C was recently reported to be an endogenous surrogate of kidney function, and a high level of cystatin C is reported to be a strong predictor of CVD; Studies that have simultaneously compared measured GFR and estimated GFR (using endogenous filtration markers such as creatinine, or newer ones such as cystatin C or β-trace protein)	yes
236	54d62ede3706e89528000002	Does magnesium sulfate improve outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients?	CONCLUSION: Patients assigned a higher serum magnesium concentration had a reduced incidence of vasospasm as seen by angiography, but the difference was not statistically significant. Clinically significant outcomes were not different between groups. 158 patients (26·2%) had poor outcome in the magnesium group compared with 151 (25·3%) in the placebo group (risk ratio [RR] 1·03, 95% CI 0·85-1·25). Our updated meta-analysis of seven randomised trials involving 2047 patients shows that magnesium is not superior to placebo for reduction of poor outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (RR 0·96, 95% CI 0·86-1·08). INTERPRETATION: Intravenous magnesium sulphate does not improve clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, therefore routine administration of magnesium cannot be recommended.  There is a tendency in the magnesium group to have better outcomes.  Due to inconsistently reported benefits and the occurrence of side effects, phase II data suggested that intravenous magnesium for SAH provided either no overall net benefit or uncertain trade-offs. Benefit was likewise not supported in the single phase III clinical trial. tatistically significant clinical benefits could not be demonstrated for the other drugs (clazosentan, statins, and magnesium). CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient evidence is available to support the use of the triple-H therapy, clazosentan, statins, or magnesium sulfate for the prevention of cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage.  Magnesium sulfate decreased the rate of cerebral infarction, but not of DCI or poor functional outcome. Regarding outcome, a beneficial effect of magnesium sulfate on outcome can not be ruled out because of sample size limitations. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings do not lend support to a beneficial effect of magnesium sulphate infusion on delayed cerebral infarction. The reduction in DCI and improvement in the clinical outcomes of aneurysmal SAH patients following magnesium sulphate infusion observed in previous pilot studies are not confirmed, although a beneficial effect cannot be ruled out because of sample size limitation. Favorable outcome (Good recovery and moderate disability, as defined by Glasgow Outcome Scale) was achieved in 20 of 30 (67%) patients receiving magnesium sulfate infusion and 16 of 30 (53%) patients receiving placebo treatment, p = 0.292, odds ratio 1.750, 95% CI 0.616-4.974. Similarly, the pooled odds ratio for favorable outcome is 1.598, 95% CI 1.074-2.377, statistically significant.  RESULTS: The worst clinical outcomes at 6 months were seen in MgSO(4) group patients, with mean plasma magnesium concentrations in the fourth quartile, and in placebo group patients, with mean such concentrations in the third and fourth quartiles. CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found to suggest that a higher mean plasma magnesium concentration improves clinical outcomes. On the contrary, we found an association between high plasma magnesium concentration and worse clinical outcomes. The proportions of patients with a favorable outcome at 6 months (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale 5 to 8) were similar, 64% in the magnesium sulfate group and 63% in the saline group (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.6). Secondary outcome analyses (modified Rankin Scale, Barthel Index, Short Form 36, and clinical vasospasm) also showed no significant differences between the 2 groups.  CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support a clinical benefit of intravenous magnesium sulfate infusion over placebo infusion in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Magnesium infusion reduced the risk of poor outcome and delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI): the relative risk was 0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46-0.83) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.53-1.00), respectively.  CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggests that intravenous magnesium therapy reduces the risk of DCI and poor outcome after aneurysmal SAH.  The incidence of delayed ischemic infarction was significantly lower in magnesium-treated patients (22% vs. 51%; p = .002); 34 of 54 magnesium patients and 27 of 53 control patients reached good outcome (p = .209). BACKGROUND: A meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit.  These data imply that intravenous magnesium therapy, besides a supposed beneficial effect on outcome, also provides pain relief for SAH patients, for whom it might also improve functional outcome. Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.  In a phase II randomized clinical trial of 283 patients, magnesium treatment reduced the risk of DCI by 34% and of poor outcome by 23%. BACKGROUND: Recent studies suggest that high-dose MgSO4 therapy is safe and reduces the incidence of DIND and subsequent poor outcome after SAH.  On-treatment analysis showed a significantly better outcome after 3 months (P = .017) and a trend toward better outcome after 1 year (P = .083).   CONCLUSIONS: High-dose MgSO4 therapy might be efficient as a prophylactic adjacent therapy after SAH to reduce the risk for poor outcome.  There was no significant difference in mortality rate at discharge (p = 0.328). A trend toward improved outcome as measured by the modifed Rankin Scale (p = 0.084), but not the Glasgow Outcome Scale (p = 1.0), was seen in the MgSO4 treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of the results suggests that MgSO4 infusion may have a role in cerebral vasospasm prophylaxis if therapy is initiated within 48 hours of aneurysm rupture. There was, however, no difference between groups in functional recovery or Glasgow Outcome Scale score.  Patients receiving MgSO4 tended to have fewer neurological deficits, better functional recovery and an improved score in GOS.  CONCLUSIONS: MgSO4 infusion after aneurysmal SAH is well tolerated and may be useful in producing better outcome. CONCLUSION: Magnesium did not seem to interfere in vasospasm frequency but apparently acted favorably in decreasing morbidity and length of hospital stay. None of the patients died; no CT evidence of ischemic infarction was present; and most had good outcomes (GOS 5 in 10 patients; GOS 4 in 8 patients). At that time, 18 patients in the treatment group and 6 in the placebo group had an excellent outcome (risk ratio, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.3 to 8.9). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that magnesium reduces DCI and subsequent poor outcome, but the results are not yet definitive.  We observed a trend in which a higher percentage of patients obtained GOS scores of 4 or 5 in the group treated with MgSO4, but the trend did not reach a statistically significant level.  Magnesium sulfate treatment improves outcome in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage: a meta-analysis study. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pilot clinical trials using magnesium sulfate in patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage have reported trends toward improvement in clinical outcomes. Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our results indicate that although there was reduced likelihood of a poor outcome for patients treated with magnesium sulfate after SAH, patient mortality was not improved. CONCLUSION: Administration of intra-arterial magnesium sulfate in combination with nicardipine was well tolerated in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral vasospasm without a significant change in MAP and ICP. Current evidence does not support the prophylactic use of magnesium sulfate in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Preliminary evidence has suggested that magnesium sulfate infusion reduces delayed ischemic neurological deficit and improves clinical outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage A meta-analysis of current data suggests that magnesium sulfate infusion improves the outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage through a reduction in delayed ischemic neurological deficit Despite the publication of several randomized controlled studies, there is still much debate on whether magnesium sulfate improves outcome in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Magnesium sulphate is a neuroprotective agent that might improve outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage by reducing the occurrence or improving the outcome of delayed cerebral ischaemia	no

266	52ef6da1c8da898910000011	Does Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) show a bias for highly expressed loci?	"However, several issues in the processing and analysis of ChIP-chip data have not been resolved fully, including the effect of background (mock control) subtraction and normalization within and across arrays  Proper normalization is essential for ChIP-chip experiments. The proposed normalization technique can correct systematic errors and compensate for the lack of mock control data, thus reducing the experimental cost and producing more accurate results. Subtraction of the mock (non-specific antibody or no antibody) control data is generally needed to eliminate the bias, but appropriate normalization obviates the need for mock experiments and increases the correlation among replicates The proposed method can handle several control samples allowing for correction of multiple sources of bias simultaneously However, the data generated will always contain noise due to e.g. repetitive regions or non-specific antibody interactions The generation of high copy numbers of DNA fragments as an artifact of the PCR step in ChIP-seq is an important source of bias of this methodology Here we describe several technical aspects of the ChIP-Seq assay that diminish bias and background noise and allow the consistent generation of high-quality data  This theoretical paper systematically characterizes the biases and properties of ChIP-seq data by comparing 62 separate publicly available datasets, using rigorous statistical models and signal processing techniques We detected a chromatin-state bias: open chromatin regions yielded higher coverage, which led to false positives if not corrected This bias had a greater effect on detection specificity than any base-composition bias This problem turns out to be surprisingly difficult, even in simple pairwise comparisons, because of the significant level of noise in ChIP-seq data We show that the ChIPnorm method removes most of the noise and bias in the data and outperforms other normalization methods We investigated the impact of library amplification bias on the identification of allele-specific (AS) molecular events from high-throughput sequencing data derived from chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChIP-seq) The 238 loci, termed ""hyper-ChIPable"", were in highly expressed regions with strong polymerase II and polymerase III enrichment signals, and the correlation between transcription level and ChIP enrichment was not limited to these 238 loci but extended genome-wide The localization of unrelated proteins, including the entire silencing complex, to the most highly transcribed genes was highly suggestive of a technical issue with the immunoprecipitations"	yes
281	550e7d6aa103b7801600000e	Does smoking increase risk for glioblastoma?	Glioma risk has consistently been inversely associated with allergy history but not with smoking history despite putative biologic plausibility. No relation was observed between glioma risk and smoking (odds ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.77, 1.10; P = 0.37), and there were no interactions for glioma risk of smoking history with any of the risk alleles.  Non-smokers with G/A and A/A genotype showed increased glioma risk compared with G/G genotype (adjusted OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.29-2.30, p = 0.0002 and adjusted OR = 1.81, 95%CI: 1.10-2.99, p = 0.020, respectively). This association was not found in ever- or current-smokers.  There was no significant association between glioma and alcohol consumption, smoking and mobile phone use.  RESULTS: We found no associations between the GSTM3, GSTP1, NQO1, CYP1A1, GSTM1, or GSTT1 polymorphisms and adult brain tumor risk with the possible exception of a weak association between the G-C (Val-Ala) GSTP1 105/114 haplotype and glioma [odds ratio (OR), 0.73; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.54, 0.99], nor was there an interaction between the effects of the GSTM3 or GSTP1 polymorphisms and cigarette smoking. We did not find any evidence for an association with life-style characteristics such as cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, use of drugs of any kind, or dietary intake of cured or smoked meat or fish. No relation was observed between glioma risk and smoking (odds ratio = 0 Glioma risk has consistently been inversely associated with allergy history but not with smoking history despite putative biologic plausibility Compared with nonsmokers, duration of cigarette smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day and pack-years of smoking were associated with increased glioma risk, although the increases in risk were relatively modest Among ever smokers, women who reported having quit smoking had a 51% increase in risk of glioma compared with never smokers (HR = 1.51, 95% CI = 0.97-2.34), while current smokers did not appear to have an increase in risk	no
287	552440452c8b63434a00000b	Are ACTA1 (alpha actin) and NEB (nebulin) genes related to nemaline myopathy?	"Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a group of congenital myopathies, characterized by the presence of distinct rod-like inclusions ""nemaline bodies"" in the sarcoplasm of skeletal muscle fibers. To date, ACTA1, NEB, TPM3, TPM2, TNNT1, and CFL2 have been found to cause NM. Nemaline myopathy (NM) is the most common congenital myopathy and is caused by mutations in various genes including NEB (nebulin), TPM2 (beta-tropomyosin), TPM3 (gamma-tropomyosin), and ACTA1 (skeletal alpha-actin). 20-25% of NM cases carry ACTA1 defects and these particular mutations usually induce substitutions of single residues in the actin protein.  Nemaline myopathy (NM) is a genetically and clinically heterogenous muscle disorder, which is myopathologically characterized by nemaline bodies. Mutations in six genes have been reported to cause NM: Nebulin (NEB Pelin 1999), alpha-skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1 Nowak 1999), alpha-slow tropomyosin (TPM3 Laing 1995), beta-tropomyosin (TPM2 Donner 2002), slow troponin T (TNNT1 Johnston 2000) and cofilin 2 (CFL2 Agrawal 2007). The majority of cases are due to mutation in NEB and ACTA1.  Nemaline myopathy is a heterogenous form of congenital myopathy characterised by a variable spectrum of clinical features, predominated in the severe form by profound muscle hypotonia and weakness accompanied by respiratory insufficiency. The clinical variability, with differing age of onset and severity of symptoms makes the diagnosis of nemaline myopathy difficult in some cases. Severe forms of nemaline myopathy may be caused by mutation of a number of different genes: skeletal muscle actin (ACTA1), nebulin (NEB) and alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3), all of which encode components of the sarcomeric thin filaments of skeletal muscle.  Most nemaline myopathy patients have mutations in the nebulin (NEB) or skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) genes.  We report muscle MRI findings of 10 patients from 8 families with nemaline myopathy. Patients with involvement of the nebulin (NEB) gene showed a consistent pattern of selective muscle involvement corresponding to clinical severity. Patients with nemaline myopathy secondary to mutations in the skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) gene showed diffuse involvement of thigh and leg muscles with relative sparing of the gastrocnemii. Congenital myopathies are clinical and genetic heterogeneous disorders characterized by skeletal muscle weakness ranging in severity. Three major forms have been identified: actin myopathy, intranuclear rod myopathy, and nemaline myopathy. Nemaline myopathy is the most common of these myopathies and is further subdivided into seven groups according to severity, progressiveness, and age of onset. At present, five genes have been linked to congenital myopathies. These include alpha-actin (ACTA1), alpha- and beta-tropomyosin (TPM3 and TPM2), troponin T (TNNT1), and nebulin (NEB).  Nemaline myopathy is a structural congenital myopathy which may show both autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive inheritance patterns. Mutations in three different genes have been identified as the cause of nemaline myopathy: the gene for slow alpha-tropomyosin 3 (TPM3) at 1q22-23, the nebulin gene (NEB) at 2q21.1-q22, and the actin gene (ACTA1) at 1q42. Nemaline myopathy is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition. The clinical spectrum ranges from severe cases with antenatal or neonatal onset and early death to late onset cases with only slow progression. Three genes are known to cause nemaline myopathy: the genes for nebulin (NEB) on chromosome 2q22, slow alpha-tropomyosin (TPM3) on chromosome 1q21 and skeletal muscle alpha-actin (ACTA1) on chromosome 1q42.

306	553fbe9fe00431e071000001	Is the regulation of Vsr endonuclease independent of the growth phase of bacteria?	Growth phase-dependent regulation of Vsr endonuclease Vsr endonuclease levels are growth phase dependent. Growth phase-dependent regulation of Vsr endonuclease may contribute to 5-methylcytosine mutational hot spots in Escherichia coli. Using rabbit polyclonal antibodies, we have shown that the Dcm cytosine methylase of Escherichia coli is maintained at a constant level during cell growth, while Vsr endonuclease levels are growth phase dependent. Vsr endonuclease, which initiates very short patch repair, has been hypothesized to regulate mutation in stationary-phase cells. The efficiency of the two pathways changes during the bacterial life cycle; MMR is more efficient during exponential growth and VSP repair is more efficient during the stationary phase. Overexpression of Vsr does dramatically increase the stationary-phase reversion of a Lac- frameshift allele, but the absence of Vsr has no effect.

307	56c85f675795f9a73e000013	Are there interactomes available for POU5F1 and SOX2?	The interactomes of POU5F1 and SOX2 enhancers in human embryonic stem cells. We assayed long-range chromosomal interactions on putative enhancers of POU5F1 and SOX2 genes in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) using 4C-Seq technique. We discovered that their frequent interacting regions mainly overlap with early DNA replication domains. The interactomes are associated with active histone marks and enriched with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine sites. In hESCs, genes within the interactomes have elevated expression. Additionally, some genes associated with the POU5F1 enhancer contribute to pluripotency. Binding sites for multiple DNA binding proteins, including ATF3, CTCF, GABPA, JUND, NANOG, RAD21 and YY1, are enriched in both interactomes.	yes
312	52b2f0d84003448f55000009	Is the Snord116 cluster associated with the Prader-Willi syndrome?	All three deletions included SNORD116, but only two encompassed parts of SNURF-SNRPN, implicating SNORD116 as the major contributor to the Prader-Willi phenotype. Our case adds further information about genotype-phenotype correlation and supports the hypothesis that SNORD116 plays a major role in the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome These results demonstrate that the AS candidate drug topotecan acts predominantly through stabilizing R loops and chromatin decondensation at the paternally expressed PWS Snord116 locus. Our study holds promise for targeted therapies to the Snord116 locus for both AS and PWS. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the loss of RNA expression from an imprinted region on chromosome 15 that includes SNRPN, SNORD115, and SNORD116.  Recently published data strongly suggest a role for the paternally expressed small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) cluster, SNORD116, in PWS etiology. Whereas loss of function of the SNORD116 genes appears to be responsible for the major features of PWS, the role of the other genes is less clear.  Recent data suggest that snoRNA Snord116 is important for the pathogenesis of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) characterized by hyperphagia and obesity. The current study was conducted to assess a potential cellular link between Snord116 and phenotypes of PWS.  The imprinted Snurf-Snrpn chromosomal domain contains two large arrays of tandemly repeated, paternally expressed box C/D small-nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) genes: the SNORD115 (H/MBII-52) and SNORD116 (H/MBII-85) gene clusters believed to play key roles in the fine-tuning of serotonin receptor (5-HT2C) pre-mRNA processing and in the etiology of the Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS), respectively There are multiple imprinted genes in this region, the loss of which contribute to the complete phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome. However, absence of a small nucleolar organizing RNA gene, SNORD116, seems to reproduce many of the clinical features. Both kits should be made available for accurate characterization of PWS/AS deletion subtypes as well as evaluating for IC and SNORD116 microdeletions. There are multiple imprinted genes in this region, the loss of which contribute to the complete phenotype of Prader-Willi syndrome. However, absence of a small nucleolar organizing RNA gene, SNORD116, seems to reproduce many of the clinical features.  Although the SNORD116 gene cluster has become a prime candidate for PWS, it cannot be excluded that other paternally expressed genes in the chromosomal region 15q11q13 contribute to the full phenotype. In addition, recently published data provide strong evidence in support of a role for the snoRNA SNORD116 cluster (HBII-85) in PWS etiology. Identification and characterization of this case provide unequivocal evidence for a critical role for the SNORD116 snoRNA molecules in PWS pathogenesis. 	yes

MED13, in turn, is negatively regulated by a heart-specific microRNA, miR-208a. On the other hand, T₃ treatment increased miR-350 expression. Through a bioinformatics screening using TargetScan, we identified thyroid hormone receptor β1 (TRβ1), which negatively regulates β-MHC transcription, as a target of miR-27a hese findings suggested that miR-27a regulates β-MHC gene expression by targeting TRβ1 in cardiomyocytes. We found that a cardiac-specific microRNA (miR-208) encoded by an intron of the alphaMHC gene is required for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis, and expression of betaMHC in response to stress and hypothyroidism. Moreover, miR-27a was demonstrated to modulate β-MHC gene regulation via thyroid hormone signaling and to be upregulated during the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells or in hypertrophic hearts in association with β-MHC gene upregulation.	yes
336	5361677c7d100faa09000008	Is there increased incidence of incontinence in athletes?	"Urinary incontinence affects women of all ages, including top female athletes, but is often under-reported. The highest prevalence of urinary incontinence is reported in those participating in high impact sports. The prevalence of female stress urinary incontinence is high, and young adults are also affected, including athletes, especially those involved in ""high-impact"" sports Analysis of these data suggests that perineal pressure is decreased in female athletes compared with nonathlete women. A lower perineal pressure correlates with increased symptoms of urinary incontinence and pelvic floor dysfunction. Urinary incontinence is a prevalent condition among athletes that is not openly discussed. High-level sport appears to be a significant independent risk factor for AI in healthy young women.  The prevalence of LUTS was 54.7%, and 30% for urinary incontinence. LUTS and incontinence are prevalent in female athletes. A relationship between sport or fitness activities and urinary incontinence (UI) previously has been described in women.  studies have also shown a high prevalence of SUI in young, physically fit female athletes.  There was urinary incontinence in female long-distance runners and a correlation with eating disorders. young female athletes participating in high-impact sports may be at higher risk for urinary incontinence. Results indicated that more than 25% of those completing surveys experienced incontinence and that more than 90% had never told anyone about their problem and had no knowledge of preventive measures; 16% reported incontinence negatively impacted their quality of life. There is a very high prevalence of urinary incontinence in women athletes. Women athletes should be counseled about the increased risk of urinary incontinence with ultra high-impact sports and eating disorders. Stress urinary incontinence is a barrier to women's participation in sport and fitness activities and, therefore, it may be a threat to women's health, self-esteem and well-being. The prevalence during sports among young, nulliparous elite athletes varies between 0% (golf) and 80% (trampolinists). The highest prevalence is found in sports involving high impact activities such as gymnastics, track and field, and some ball games Urinary leakage is common among elite athletes and dancers, particularly during training, but also during daily life activities. There is a high prevalence of stress and urge incontinence in female elite athletes. The frequency of SUI and urge incontinence was significantly higher in eating disordered athletes compared with healthy athletes. High impact sports activities may produce urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence during physical stresses is common in young nulliparous wome Incontinence during physical stresses is common in young, highly fit, nulliparous women."	yes
377	51680b05298dcd4e51000064	Does Serca2a bind PLN in the heart?	The human phospholamban Arg14-deletion mutant localizes to plasma membrane and interacts with the Na/K-ATPase. Moreover, PLN-R14Del did not co-immunoprecipitate with SERCA2a (as did WT-PLN), n this review, we attempted to highlight the functional significance of PLN in vertebrate cardiac physiology. We will refer to the huge literature on mammals in order to describe the molecular characteristics of this protein, its interaction with SERCA2a There is clear evidence for direct regulatory protein-protein interactions between phospholamban (PLN) and the Ca2+-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) in cytoplasmic domains These results suggest that PLN modulates the apparent Ca2+ affinity of SERCA2a through intramembrane interactions, which are disrupted at long range and in concert with disruption of the well characterized cytoplasmic interactions. Phospholamban (PLN), a homopentameric, integral membrane protein, reversibly inhibits cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) activity through intramembrane interactions. The concentration of this inhibited complex is determined by the dissociation constant for the PLN pentamer (which is mutation-sensitive) and by the dissociation constant for the PLN/SERCA2a heterodimer (which is likely to be mutation-sensitive). These results support the proposal that PLN inhibition of SERCA2a involves, first, depolymerization of PLN and, second, the formation of inhibitory interactions between monomeric PLN and SERCA2a. SLN and PLN appear to bind to the same regulatory site in SERCA. However, in a ternary complex, PLN occupies the regulatory site and SLN binds to the exposed side of PLN and to SERCA. Cellular and biochemical studies revealed that, unlike wild-type PLN, PLN(R9C) did not directly inhibit SERCA2a. . Conversely, using anti-SERCA2a antibody, both PLN and acylphosphatase were co-immunoprecipitated with SERCA2a, and the PLN amount in the precipitate decreased with increasing acylphosphatase concentrations. Reconstitution of the cytoplasmic interaction between phospholamban and Ca(2+)-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. Phospholamban (PLN) reversibly inhibits the Ca(2+)-ATPase of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a) through a direct protein-protein interaction, playing a pivotal role in the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+) in heart muscle cells. Phospholamban (PLN) is a key regulator of Ca(2+) homeostasis and contractility in the heart. Its regulatory effects are mediated through its interaction with the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, (SERCA2a), resulting in alterations of its Ca(2+)-affinity In a co-immunoprecipitation of PLN with SERCA2a, the physical interaction between the two proteins was increased in PUGNAc-treated cardiomyocytes.	yes

Here we profiled the transcriptome of primary brown and white adipocytes, preadipocytes, and cultured adipocytes and identified 175 lncRNAs that are specifically regulated during adipogenesis. Many lncRNAs are adipose-enriched, strongly induced during adipogenesis, and bound at their promoters by key transcription factors such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (CEBPα). RNAi-mediated loss of function screens identified functional lncRNAs with varying impact on adipogenesis. Collectively, we have identified numerous lncRNAs that are functionally required for proper adipogenesis.

383	5156beb4d24251bc05000089	Can Alzheimer's disease related miRNAs be detected in patients' blood?	miRNAs are aberrantly expressed in AD, and these have been implicated in the regulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, tau, inflammation, cell death, and other aspects which are the main pathomechanisms of AD. In addition, regulation of miRNAs varies in blood, and cerebral spinal fluid may indicate alterations in AD. miRNA microarray analysis was carried out on blood of rats at 1 week and 2 months after injection. RESULTS: Many up- and downregulated miRNAs were detected. Blood miRNAs could be useful as biomarkers for exposure to nanoparticles. miR-298 regulates β-amyloid (Aβ) precursor protein-converting enzyme-1 (BACE1) in Alzheimer's disease.  We previously studied microRNAs (miRNAs) in AD autopsy brain samples and reported a connection between miR-137, -181c, -9, -29a/b and AD, through the regulation of ceramides. In this study, the potential role of these miRNAs as diagnostic markers for AD was investigated. We identified that these miRNAs were down-regulated in the blood serum of probable AD patients.  287 with Alzheimer disease (AD) as compared with 344 age- and gender-matched controls. In addition, we evaluated expression levels of hnRNP-A1 and its regulatory microRNA (miR)-590-3p in blood cells from patients and controls. Decreased relative expression levels of hsa-miR-590-3p was observed in patients with AD versus controls (0.685 ± 0.080 versus 0.931 ± 0.111, p = 0.079), and correlated negatively with hnRNP-A1 mRNA levels (r = -0.615, p = 0.0237). expression analysis of Sp1 and its regulatory microRNAs (hsa-miR-29b and hsa-miR-375) has been performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), together with Sp1 protein analysis. Significantly decreased relative expression levels of hsa-miR-29b, but not of hsa-miR-375, were observed in AD patients Sp1 and its regulatory hsa-miR-29b are deregulated in AD patients, possibly leading to aberrant production of downstream target genes involved in the pathogenesis.  We previously observed that miR-137, -181c, -9, and 29a/b post-transcriptionally regulate SPT levels, and the corresponding miRNA levels in the blood sera are potential diagnostic biomarkers for AD. Here, we observe a negative correlation between cortical Aβ42 and sera Aβ42, and a positive correlation between cortical miRNA levels and sera miRNA levels suggesting their potential as noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers.	yes
400	530b4f49970c65fa6b00000a	Can we use platelet biomarkers to study Alzheimer's disease?	Platelet biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease. platelets are the most important source of circulating forms of the amyloid precursor protein and other important proteins such as Tau and glycogen synthase kinase-3B. Alternative plasma and platelet measures are described, The success of these studies led to the application of platelet proteomics to the study of several pathologies where platelets play a fundamental role. Those include platelet-related disorders, such as storage pool disease, gray platelet syndrome, and Quebec platelet disorder; diseases where unwanted platelet activation is highly relevant, such as thrombosis and cardiovascular disease; and other diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, uremia, or Alzheimer's disease. 	yes
438	514a0f0ad24251bc05000052	Does the Oncotype DX test work with paraffin embedded tissues?	The Oncotype-DX Breast Cancer Assay (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) quantifies gene expression for 21 genes in breast cancer tissue by performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour blocks that are obtained during initial surgery (lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy) of women with early breast cancer that is newly diagnosed. Oncotype DXtrade mark, is a diagnostic test comprised of a 21-gene assay applied to paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue, which allows physicians to predict subgroups of hormone-receptor-positive, node-negative patients who may benefit from hormonal therapy alone or require adjuvant chemotherapy to attain the best survival outcome. Oncotype DX is a clinically validated, high-complexity, multianalyte reverse transcription-PCR genomic test that predicts the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence in early-stage, node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.  We therefore investigated the analytical performance of the assay. Assays used a pooled RNA sample from fixed paraffin-embedded tissues to evaluate the analytical performance of a 21-gene panel with respect to amplification efficiency, precision, linearity, and dynamic range, as well as limits of detection and quantification. One such strategy is the 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX), which is currently in commercial use in the USA. One advantage of this test is the use of paraffin-embedded blocks instead of previous methods, which required fresh frozen tissue.  We used paraffin-embedded core biopsies from a completed phase II trial to identify genes that correlate with response to primary chemotherapy.  In addition to the individual genes, the correlation of the Oncotype DX Recurrence Score with pCR was examined RNA was extracted from paraffin blocks to develop the 21-gene Recurrence Score assay (Oncotype DX)	yes
440	5149e23dd24251bc0500004b	Is marijuana use associated with increased risk for stroke?	The illicit drugs more commonly associated with stroke are psychomotor stimulants, such as amphetamine and cocaine. Less commonly implicated are opioids and psychotomimetic drugs, including cannabis. Among 326 patients (184 males), the most frequent stroke risk factors overall were dyslipidaemia (187), smoking (161), hypertension (105) and obesity (92). Fifty-one patients used illicit drugs, mostly comprising marijuana and amphetamines. Patients in Adelaide are more likely to be obese, to be misusing marijuana and amphetamines, to suffer a cardioembolic event and to have a stroke that concurrently affects both the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation. RCVS was spontaneous in 37% of patients and secondary in the 63% others, to postpartum in 5 and to exposure to various vasoactive substances in 37, mainly cannabis, selective serotonin-recapture inhibitors and nasal decongestants. We reported two cases of young stroke associated with drug misuse. Case 1 used amphetamine, cocaine, marijuana and LSD for few yaers, and developed occlusion of a middle cerebral artery. Case 2 presented aphasia shortly after marijuana smoking. Marijuana may have accelerated stroke onset, but essential cause of stroke in this case must be protein S mutation. Cannabis is the most widely consumed among the illicit drugs worldwide, but it has only exceptionally been associated to cerebrovascular disease. We here describe 2 young patients (26 and 29 years, respectively) who suffered from ischemic stroke in temporal relation with cannabis consumption. The review of the literature on this topic reveals another 18 patients with stroke in association to cannabis use. Although a causal relationship is difficult to establish due to the widespread use of cannabis, this drug may play an etiologic role in ischemic stroke. Marijuana may trigger a myocardial infarction and have a vasospastic effect. Despite the fact that cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug, there are only a few reports associating its use with cerebrovascular disease. We describe a patient who suffered three ischaemic strokes immediately after cannabis consumption. Cannabis use may be associated with ischaemic stroke in young patients, but its mechanism is unclear. A right occipital ischemic stroke occurred in a 37-year-old Albanese man with a previously uneventful medical history, 15 min after having smoked a cigarette with approximately 250 mg of marijuana. Therefore, as the family history for cerebrovascular events, blood pressure, clotting tests, examinations for thrombophilia, vasculitis, extracranial and intracranial arteries and cardiac investigations were normal or respectively negative, the stroke was attributed to the chronic cannabis consumption. Three adolescent males had similar presentations of headache, fluctuating level of consciousness or lethargy, visual disturbance, and variable ataxia after self-administration of marijuana. Episodic marijuana use may represent a risk factor for stroke in childhood, particularly in the posterior circulation. Although several mechanisms exist by which marijuana use might contribute to the development of chronic cardiovascular conditions or acutely trigger cardiovascular events, there are few data regarding marijuana/THC use and cardiovascular disease outcomes. Reported here is the case of a previously healthy young man who smoked marijuana on a daily basis and had an occipital lobe stroke; he was found to be heterozygous for factor V Leiden. This case suggests that marijuana smoking may increase the risk of arterial thrombosis in otherwise healthy individuals who are heterozygous for factor V Leiden. Thus, chronic abuse of marijuana might be a risk factor for stroke. A 22-year-old man with a five-year history of drug and alcohol abuse presented with a left hemiparesis preceded by three transient ischaemic attacks, two of which occurred whilst smoking cannabis. Substance abuse was the only identifiable risk factor for cerebrovascular disease. Chronic marijuana smoking, however, seems to reduce CBF. Research directions might include more studies of cardiovascular disease outcomes and relationships of marijuana with cardiovascular risk factors, studies of metabolic and physiologic effects of chronic marijuana use that may affect cardiovascular disease risk, increased understanding of the role of the cannabinoid receptor system in cardiovascular regulation, and studies to determine if there is a therapeutic role for cannabinoids in blood pressure control or for neuroprotection after stroke.	yes
445	58aa0a62396a458e50000007	Are microtubules marked by glutamylation?	Together with detyrosination, glutamylation and other modifications, tubulin acetylation may form a unique 'language' to regulate microtubule structure and function. Glutamylation, the most prevalent tubulin posttranslational modification, marks stable microtubules and regulates recruitment and activity of microtubule- interacting proteins. Enzymes of the tubulin tyrosine ligase-like (TTLL) family posttranslationally modify and thereby mark microtubules by glutamylation, generating specific recognition sites for microtubule-interacting proteins.  PTMs of the cytoskeleton, including phosphorylation, glycosylation, ubiquitination, detyrosination/tyrosination, (poly)glutamylation and (poly)glycylation, acetylation, sumoylation, and palmitoylation, will be addressed in this chapter. The tubulin posttranslational modifications: acetylation, detyrosination, polyglutamylation, and polyglycylation play important roles in microtubule functions In most eukaryotic cells, tubulin is subjected to posttranslational glutamylation, a conserved modification of unclear function.	yes
466	589a246878275d0c4a000030	Is vortioxetine effective for treatment of depression?	Vortioxetine is the most recently approved medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).  [Vortioxetine: a new antidepressant to treat depressive episodes]. Vortioxetine is a new antidepressant, which mechanism of action is multimodal, targeting the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT3, 5-HT7 receptors and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT).  In short-term studies (8 weeks), vortioxetine is more efficacious than placebo in decreasing depressive symptoms as measured by the MADRS total score, response rate (vortioxetine: 53.2% vs placebo: 35.2%) and remission rate (vortioxetine: 29.2% vs placebo: 19.3%). In a long-term study (52 weeks), vortioxetine is also superior to placebo in preventing relapses and recurrences. Moreover, in second line treatment, after failure of a first line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin norepinephrin reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), vortioxetine is superior to agomelatine in improving depressive symptoms and achieving response and remission.  Against this background, we feature the novel antidepressants vortioxetine, vilazodone and milnacipran/levomilnacipran with regard to their serotonin receptor targets such as the 5-HT1A, 5-HT3 and 5-HT7 which may account for their specific effects on certain symptoms of depression (e.g. cognition and anxiety) as well as a characteristic side-effect profile. CONCLUSION: Vortioxetine dominated venlafaxine XR in South Korea and is a relevant treatment option for MDD patients initiating or switching therapy. Vortioxetine: a New Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder. INTRODUCTION: Vortioxetine is a structurally novel medication that has recently been approved for treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). EXPERT OPINION: Results of placebo-controlled trials suggest efficacy and an overall safety profile comparable to existing first-line antidepressants.  The authors suggest that vortioxetine is currently a good second-line antidepressant option and shows promise, pending additional long-term data, to become a first-line antidepressant option. Clinical studies indicate that vortioxetine is effective in the treatment of major depression, though there is no suggestion of superiority over active comparators. Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day. Vortioxetine was significantly more effective than was placebo, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.118 (95% CIs, -0.203 to -0.033, P = 0.007). Vortioxetine for the treatment of depression. Vortioxetine for the treatment of major depression. Vortioxetine (Lu-AA-21004; 1-[2-(2,4-dimethylphenylsulfanyl)phenyl]piperazine hydrobromide) is a novel orally active molecule that is being investigated by Lundbeck and Takeda for the treatment of major depression and generalized anxiety disorders. Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is a multi-modal antidepressant in clinical development for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). A randomized, double-blind, fixed-dose study comparing the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine 2.5 and 10 mg in acute treatment of adults with generalized anxiety disorder. Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day. Secondary endpoints included response and remission rates, anxiety symptoms(Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale), Clinical Global Impression, overall functioning (Sheehan Disability Scale), health-related quality of life(EuroQol 5 Dimensions), productivity (work limitation questionnaire) and family functioning (Depression and Family Functioning Scale).RESULTS: Primary endpoint noninferiority was established and vortioxetine (n = 252) was superior to agomelatine (n = 241) by 2.2 MADRS points (p<0.01). Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is an antidepressant with a mechanism of action thought to be related to a combination of 2 pharmacologic actions: direct modulation of several receptors and inhibition of the serotonin transporter.To evaluate the efficacy of vortioxetine 10 and 20 mg once daily in outpatients with major depressive disorder.This 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was conducted from July 2010 to January 2012 among adults with a primary diagnosis of recurrent major depressive disorder (DSM-IV-TR).Eligible subjects were randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment arms: vortioxetine 10 mg, vortioxetine 20 mg, or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is a new antidepressant that combines a number of neurotransmitter reuptake and receptor effects that have been thought to predict efficacy as a treatment for depressive and anxiety disorders.This review summarizes the pharmacology and neurobiology of vortioxetine In the study of elderly patients, vortioxetine 5 mg (n = 136) improved 12-item Health Status Questionnaire scores significantly more than placebo (n = 148) for the domains of health perception (10.4, P &lt; 0.0001, SES of 0.54), mental health (7.9, P &lt; 0.001, SES of 0.44), and energy (6.4, P &lt; 0.05, SES of 0.28) (FAS, mixed model for repeated measures).Vortioxetine yielded significant, meaningful HRQoL improvements in 6 MDD studies of 6 to 8 weeks duration. All references included were published between 1999 and 2014.All studies that included humans and were published in English, with data describing vortioxetine for the treatment of MDD, were reviewed.Vortioxetine is a novel multimodal antidepressant agent, which inhibits the 5-HT transporter protein, acts as a 5-HT3 antagonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, and a partial agonist of the 5-HT1B receptor Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day Vortioxetine is an antidepressant with multimodal activity which has shown efficacy in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients in six of ten short-term, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (completed end 2012).We performed meta-regression analyses to indirectly compare vortioxetine to seven marketed antidepressants with different mechanisms of action Data were available from 51 human trials involving vortioxetine, and included a total of 7,666 healthy volunteers and patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or generalized anxiety disorder who were exposed to at least 1 dose of vortioxetine for a total of 2,743 patient-years.Vortioxetine was effective in treating MDD in the United States at a dose of 20 mg/d Vortioxetine is a recently approved multimodal antidepressant with anxiolytic properties in preclinical studies.This double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine in subjects with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder.Subjects (n = 457) were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with placebo or vortioxetine 2.5 or 10 mg once daily There was a significant difference for nausea between the two groups (OR=3.01, 95 % CI=2.22-4.09, Z=7.08, P=0.00001), but no significant differences were observed for the other four adverse effects.CONCLUSIONS: For the treatment of major depressive disorder, our results show that a dose of 5 mg/day vortioxetine was more effective, but more easily induced nausea, compared to placebo.

Vortioxetine has been effective in various animal models of depression and anxiety and clinical studies have shown the antidepressant and antianxiety properties of vortioxetine in a dose range of 5-20 mg/day.  Clinical studies indicate that vortioxetine is effective in the treatment of major depression, though there is no suggestion of superiority over active comparators. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was significantly higher in the duloxetine group than in the vortioxetine group.Duloxetine was more effective but less well-tolerated than vortioxetine in MDD. There was no significant difference in discontinuation rates between vortioxetine and comparators owing to inefficacy (OR 0.983, 95% CI 0.585 to 1.650), whereas discontinuation owing to AEs was significantly less common in the vortioxetine than in the comparator group (OR 0.728, 95% CI 0.554 to 0.957).Studies examining the role of vortioxetine in the treatment of MDD are limited.Although our results suggest that vortioxetine may be an effective treatment option for MDD, they should be interpreted and translated into clinical practice with caution, as the meta-analysis was based on a l We performed a meta-analysis to increase the statistical power of these studies and enhance our current understanding of the role of vortioxetine in the treatment of MDD.We performed an extensive search of databases and the clinical trial registry. BACKGROUND: Vortioxetine is a recently approved multimodal antidepressant with anxiolytic properties in preclinical studies.OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of vortioxetine in subjects with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder.METHODS: Subjects (n = 457) were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment with placebo or vortioxetine 2.5 or 10 mg once daily. Vortioxetine significantly improved objective and subjective measures of cognitive function in adults with recurrent MDD and these effects were largely independent of its effect on improving depressive symptoms. Furthermore, a statistically significant number of patients with MDD who were on vortioxetine have achieved a greater than or equal to 50% reduction in depression symptoms from baseline. BACKGROUND: Vortioxetine is a novel multimodal compound that has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Although our results suggest that vortioxetine may be an effective treatment option for MDD, they should be interpreted and translated into clinical practice with caution, as the meta-analysis was based on a limited number of heterogeneous RCTs.. Vortioxetine is an effective agent for the treatment of MDD, but it does not have any clear advantages over other available treatment options.. Vortioxetine was significantly more effective than placebo for acute treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Duloxetine was more effective but less well-tolerated than vortioxetine in MDD.	yes
478	58a6d89660087bc10a00002b	Could plasmepsins be used as targets for developing anti-malaria drugs?	Fighting malaria: structure-guided discovery of nonpeptidomimetic plasmepsin inhibitors. Given that the parasite needs the resulting amino acid building blocks for its growth and development, plasmepsins are an important antimalarial drug target.  Due to early crystallographic evidence, plasmepsin II (Plm II) emerged as well explored target to develop novel antimalarials as well as a starting point to develop inhibitors targeting some other subtypes of plasmepsins i.e. Plm I, II, IV and V. With the advancements in drug discovery, several computational and synthetic approaches were employed in order to develop novel inhibitors targeting Plm II.  Structural basis for plasmepsin V inhibition that blocks export of malaria proteins to human erythrocytes. Plasmepsin V, an essential aspartyl protease of malaria parasites, has a key role in the export of effector proteins to parasite-infected erythrocytes. Consequently, it is an important drug target for the two most virulent malaria parasites of humans, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. Plasmepsin V (PmV) is an essential Plasmodium protease and a highly promising antimalarial target, which still lacks molecular characterization and drug-like inhibitors. Our inhibitors act 'on-target', confirmed by cellular interference of PmV function and biochemical interaction with inhibitors.  Our work disclosed novel pursuable drug design strategies for highly efficient PmV inhibition highlighting novel molecular elements necessary for picomolar activity against PmV. All the presented data are discussed in respect to human aspartic proteases and previously reported inhibitors, highlighting differences and proposing new strategies for drug development. High binding likeness on antimalarial target plasmepsin was detected through molecular docking.  This provides the first direct evidence that PMV activity is essential for protein export in Plasmodium spp. and for parasite survival in human erythrocytes and validates PMV as an antimalarial drug target. The export mechanism involves the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL), which is a cleavage site for the parasite protease, Plasmepsin V (PMV).  Plasmepsin II (PM II) is an attractive target for anti-malaria drug discovery, which involves in host hemoglobin degradation in the acidic food vacuole. These methods are utilized to search for inhibitors of the aspartyl proteases, plasmepsin II and cathepsin D. Plasmepsin II, a protease found in the malaria parasite, hydrolyzes human hemoglobin, the nutrient source for the parasite and is a new target for anti-malaria therapy. Given recent advances in understanding the fundamental roles of the various plasmepsins, it is likely that the most effective antimalarial plasmepsin targets will be the non-digestive vacuole plasmepsins. Plasmepsins (PMs) are essential proteases of the plasmodia parasites and are therefore promising targets for developing drugs against malaria. Therefore, the plasmepsins of malaria parasites have been recognized as attractive antimalarial drug targets. As inhibition of plasmepsins leads to the parasite's death, these enzymes can be utilized as potential drug targets. falciparum plasmepsins II and IV make structure-based drug design of antimalarial compounds that focus on inhibiting plasmepsins possible. The malarial parasite encodes two homologous aspartic proteases, plasmepsins I and II, which are essential components of its hemoglobin-degradation pathway and are novel targets for antimalarial drug development. vivax plasmepsins (PvPMs) from different geographical regions are of utmost importance for drugs and vaccine designs for anti-malarial strategies. In P.falciparum, plasmepsins I, II, IV and HAP have been directly implicated in hemoglobin degradation during malaria infection, and are now considered targets for anti-malarial drug design. These results shed light on the role of V105 and T108 residues in plasmepsin specificities, and they should be useful in structure-based design of novel, selective inhibitors that may serve as antimalarial drugs. The aspartic proteases plasmepsins, whose inhibition leads to parasite death, are classified as targets for the design of potent drugs. A large compound library of about 1 million chemical compounds was docked on 5 different targets of plasmepsins using two different docking software, namely FlexX and AutoDock. Plasmodium aspartic proteases known as plasmepsins play an important role on haemoglobin degradation and are being studied as drug targets for chemotherapy of malaria. Our study revealed about 100 parasite-coded gene products that included many known drug targets such as Pf hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase, Pf L-lactate dehydrogenase, and Plasmepsins. The two aspartic proteases, plasmepsins I and II, from Plasmodium falciparum have recently emerged as potential targets. Plasmepsins are highly promising as drug targets, especially when combined with the inhibition of falcipains that are also involved in hemoglobin catabolism. Among such enzymes, Plasmepsins (aspartic proteases) and, especially, Falcipains (cysteine proteases) are highly promising antimalarial drug targets. The high sequence conservations between the plasmepsins from the isolates support the notion that the enzymes could be reliable targets for new antimalarial chemotherapeutics. Due to early crystallographic evidence, plasmepsin II (Plm II) emerged as well explored target to develop novel antimalarials as well as a starting point to develop inhibitors targeting some other subtypes of plasmepsins i.e. Plasmepsin, an aspartic protease, which is involved in the hemoglobin breakdown into smaller peptides emerged as a crucial target to develop new chemical entities to counter malaria. were employed in order to develop new chemical entities targeting Plm II. With the advancements in drug discovery, several computational and synthetic approaches were employed in order to develop novel inhibitors targeting Plm II. vivax plasmepsins (PvPMs) from different geographical regions are of utmost importance for drugs and vaccine designs for anti-malarial strategies.. We developed a potent inhibitor of plasmepsin V, called WEHI-842, which directly mimics the Plasmodium export element (PEXEL). In order to validate appropriate use of PM4 as potential anti-malarial drug target, studies on genetic and structural variations among P. Over the past decade, much effort has been placed towards developing plasmepsin inhibitors as antimalarial agents, particularly targeting the digestive vacuole.	yes

We begin by showing that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs. In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state.  ULEs are located in intergenic or intronic regions and are depleted from segmental duplications. Interestingly, human UCEs have been reported to be strongly depleted among segmental duplications and benign copy number variants (CNVs). In addition, here we show that these elements are preferentially found in pathogenic deletions (enrichment ratio 3.6 vs. 0.5 in duplications), and that this association is not related with a higher content of genes. In contrast, pathogenic CNVs lacking UCEs showed almost a threefold higher content in genes We have demonstrated that nonexonic UCEs are depleted among segmental duplications (SDs) and copy number variants (CNVs) and proposed that their ultraconservation may reflect a mechanism of copy counting via comparison. Mammalian ultraconserved elements are strongly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Here, we show that UCEs are significantly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants. Notably, of the UCEs that are found in segmental duplications or copy number variants, the majority overlap exons, indicating, along with other findings presented, that UCEs overlapping exons represent a distinct subset. Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are strongly depleted from segmental duplications and copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome, suggesting that deletion or duplication of a UCE can be deleterious to the mammalian cell. Here, we show that UCEs are significantly depleted among segmental duplications and copy number variants.

495	58bd672d02b8c60953000011	Could divalent metal transporter 1 deficiency lead to anemia?	The divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is a major iron transporter required for iron absorption and erythropoiesis. Loss of DMT1 function results in microcytic anemia.  Dysfunction of human DMT1 is associated with several pathologies such as iron deficiency anemia hemochromatosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, as well as colorectal cancer and esophageal adenocarcinoma, making DMT1 an attractive target for drug discovery. Deficiency of the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) leads to hypochromic microcytic anemia. We have previously shown that DMT1 deficiency impairs erythroid differentiation and induces apoptosis of erythroid cells.  We propose that DMT1 deficiency negatively affects metabolism and life span of mature erythrocytes; two other aspects of defective erythropoiesis which contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Hypochromic microcytic anemia associated with ineffective erythropoiesis caused by recessive mutations in divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) can be improved with high-dose erythropoietin supplementation.  Belgrade rats exhibit microcytic, hypochromic anemia and systemic iron deficiency due to a glycine-to-arginine mutation at residue 185 in a metal ion transporter of a divalent metal transporter/divalent cation transporter/solute carrier 11 group A member 2 or 3 (DMT1/DCT1/SLC11A2), a member of the natural-resistance-associated macrophage protein (Nramp) family.

Microcytic anemia (mk/mk) mice defective in DMT1 and wild-type mice were exposed to either bleomycin or saline via intratracheal instillation and the resultant lung injury was compared.  Deficiency of the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) leads to hypochromic microcytic anemia. The divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) is a major iron transporter required for iron absorption and erythropoiesis. This mutation severely impairs the iron transport capability of DMT1, leading to systemic iron deficiency and anemia.	yes

Inhalation of Yersinia pestis results in primary pneumonic plague, a highly lethal and rapidly progressing necrotizing pneumonia Yersinia pestis causes the fatal respiratory disease pneumonic plague. Pulmonary infection by Yersinia pestis causes pneumonic plague, a rapidly progressing and often fatal disease. Pulmonary infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis causes pneumonic plague, an often-fatal disease for which no vaccine is presently available. Yersinia pestis causes the fatal respiratory disease pneumonic plague Pneumonic plague is a deadly respiratory disease caused by Yersinia pestis On July 8, 2014, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) laboratory identified Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague, in a blood specimen collected from a man (patient A) hospitalized with pneumonia. Early emergence of Yersinia pestis as a severe respiratory pathogen. The aerosol form of the bacterium Yersinia pestis causes the pneumonic plague, a rapidly fatal disease  plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, has historically been regarded as one of the deadliest pathogens known to mankind, having caused three major pandemics. After being transmitted by the bite of an infected flea arthropod vector, Y. pestis can cause three forms of human plague: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic, Plague is an infectious disease caused by the Yersinia pestis microorganism, which is transmitted to the human host from a natural reservoir (different rodent species) by a flea bite. Plague is still encountered in humans in the areas of its enzootic prevalence in local rodent populations. Infection by flea bite results in a bubonic or septicemic plague, possibly complicated by secondary pneumonia. The person with pneumonic symptoms may be a source of a droplet-borne inhalatory infection for other people who consequently develop primary pneumonic plague.  uring pneumonic plague, the bacterium Yersinia pestis elicits the development of inflammatory lung lesions that continue to expand throughout infection.  In November 2006, the Uganda Ministry of Health received reports of an increase in bubonic plague cases and a possible outbreak of pneumonic plague among residents in the Arua and Nebbi districts.

523	5884755ce56acf5176000007	Can valproic acid prolong survival of glioblastoma patients?	For patients who presented with epilepsy, the use of the antiepileptic drug VPA did not associate with survival when compared with patients who did not receive VPA treatment. This prognostic effect is not solely explained by early diagnosis, and survival is not associated with VPA treatment. Several in vivo and in vitro studies have indicated that VPA has radiosensitizing effects for gliomas and radioprotective influence on normal brain tissue or hippocampal neurons. The results of several retrospective studies have also indicated potential benefit to improve survival of patients with GBM. Moreover, the promising treatment results of a phase 2 trial of concurrent radiation therapy, temozolomide, and VPA for patients with GBM have been recently reported.  While there have not been any novel anti-GBM therapeutics approved for many years, there has been the gradual accumulation of clinical data suggesting that the widely used anti-convulsant agent, valproic acid (VPA) may significantly prolong survival in GBM patients.  Additionally, VPA may result in improved outcomes compared to historical data and merits further study. Several retrospective studies in seizure patients with glioblastoma treated with chemotherapy have provided evidence for a moderately improved survival with the use of valproic acid, possibly due to inhibition of histone deacetylase Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients While there have not been any novel anti-GBM therapeutics approved for many years, there has been the gradual accumulation of clinical data suggesting that the widely used anti-convulsant agent, valproic acid (VPA) may significantly prolong survival in GBM patients Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma. Valproic acid use during radiation therapy for glioblastoma associated with improved survival. Patients receiving VPA alone (97 [16.9%]) appeared to derive more survival benefit from TMZ/RT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.63) than patients receiving an EIAED only (252 [44%]) (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.90) or patients not receiving any AED (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.93).  Several retrospective studies in seizure patients with glioblastoma treated with chemotherapy have provided evidence for a moderately improved survival with the use of valproic acid, possibly due to inhibition of histone deacetylase. Several uncontrolled retrospective case series and a post hoc analysis of the registration trial for temozolomide indicated an association between valproic acid (VPA) use and improved survival outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.To confirm the hypothesis suggested above, a combined analysis of survival association of antiepileptic drug use at the start of chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide was performed in the pooled patient cohort (n = 1,869) of four contemporary randomized clinical trials in newly diagnosed glioblastoma: AVAGlio (Avastin in Glioblastoma; NCT00943826), CENTRIC (Cilengitide, Temozolomide, and Radiation T Several clinical studies have reported that valproic acid could prolong survival of GBM patients. Patients receiving VPA alone (97 [16.9%]) appeared to derive more survival benefit from TMZ/RT (hazard ratio [HR] 0.39, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.24-0.63) than patients receiving an EIAED only (252 [44%]) (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.53-0.90) or patients not receiving any AED (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.93).VPA may be preferred over an EIAED in patients with glioblastoma who require an AED during TMZ-based chemoradiotherapy. The combination of radiotherapy, temozolomide and valproic acid (VPA) has shown some promise in retrospective analyses of patients with glioblastoma, although their mechanisms of action remain unknown.We investigated the in vitro and in vivo effects of pretreating glioma cells with temozolomide and VPA as an immunization strategy to boost an adaptive immune response in a syngeneic mouse model.Temozolomide and VPA induced autophagy in GL261 glioma cells, and caused tumor antigen-specific T-cells to become activated effector T-cells. Prolonged survival with valproic acid use in the EORTC/NCIC temozolomide trial for glioblastoma.	yes

532	58e3d1743e8b6dc87c000001	Are hepadnaviral minichromosomes free of nucleosomes?	Several nucleosome-protected sites in a region of the DHBV genome [nucleotides (nt) 2000 to 2700], known to harbor various cis transcription regulatory elements, were consistently identified in all DHBV-positive liver samples. In addition, we observed other nucleosome protection sites in DHBV minichromosomes that may vary among individual ducks, but the pattern of MNase mapping in those regions is transmittable from the adult ducks to the newly infected ducklings. nucleosomes along viral cccDNA in the minichromosomes are not random but sequence-specifically positioned. Investigators studying the structure and function of hepadnaviral CCC DNA (3) have provided evidence that suggests that this structure exists in the nucleus of infected hepatocytes as a heterogeneous population of viral minichromosomes, which range from half to fully chromatinized, thought to be owing to their association with variable numbers of nucleosomes. Characterization of nucleosome positioning in hepadnaviral covalently closed circular DNA minichromosomes. To obtain insight on the structure of hepadnaviral cccDNA minichromosomes, we utilized ducks infected with the duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) as a model and determined the in vivo nucleosome distribution pattern on viral cccDNA by the micrococcal nuclease (MNase) mapping and genome-wide PCR amplification of isolated mononucleosomal DHBV DNA. Mature SV40 minichromosomes are estimated to contain about 27 nucleosomes (error +/- 2), except for those molecules with a nucleosome-free gap, which are interpreted to contain 25 nucleosomes (error +/- 2). In vitro replication in the presence of protein-free competitor DNA shows that replicating trypsinized minichromosomes do not lose nucleosomes and replicating competitor DNA does not gain nucleosomes. In vitro replication in the presence of protein-free competitor DNA shows that replicating trypsinized minichromosomes do not lose nucleosomes and replicating competitor DNA does not gain nucleosomes. We conclude that in both cases parental nucleosomes are transferred to progeny DNA, and, in addition, that an assembly of new nucleosomes occurs during the replication of native minichromosomes. In contrast, the replicated untreated minichromosomes were found to be densely packed with nucleosomes, indicating that an assembly of new nucleosomes occurred during in vitro replication.

541	58ec72a4eda5a5767200000f	Is tirilazad effective for treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage?	There was no significant difference between the two groups at the end of follow up for the primary outcome, death (odds ratio (OR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 1.06), or in poor outcome (death, vegetative state or severe disability) (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.21). During the treatment period, fewer patients developed delayed cerebral ischaemia in the tirilazad group than in the control group (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.93). Subgroup analyses did not demonstrate any significant difference in effects of tirilazad on clinical outcomes.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that tirilazad, in addition to nimodipine, reduces mortality or improves poor outcome in patients with aneurysmal SAH. This clinical trial suggest that tirilazad mesylate, at a dosage of 6 mg/kg/day, improves overall outcome in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. Tirilazad is ineffective.There are many possible successful treatment options for preventing vasospasm, delayed ischemic neurologic deficits, and poor neurologic outcome following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, further multicenter RCTs need to be performed to determine if there is a significant benefit from their use Findings from previous multicenter clinical trials have suggested that tirilazad mesylate, a synthetic nonhormonal 21-aminosteroid, might be effective in preventing delayed cerebral ischemia following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). This clinical trial suggest that tirilazad mesylate, at a dosage of 6 mg/kg/day, improves overall outcome in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients.	no
546	5890ede0621ea6ff7e000007	Is there an association between Histone H3.3 mutations and glioma?	PURPOSE: Histone H3.3 (H3F3A) mutation in the codon for lysine 27 (K27M) has been found as driver mutations in pediatric glioblastoma and has been suggested to play critical roles in the pathogenesis of thalamic gliomas and diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. We report a case of thalamic glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation, which was detected in both the primary tumor diagnosed as diffuse astrocytoma obtained during the first surgery and also in the tumor diagnosed as anaplastic astrocytoma obtained at the second surgery. CONCLUSION: This report demonstrates minute neuroradiological and pathological features of malignant transformation from thalamic low grade glioma with H3F3A K27M mutation. Recently, sequencing of tumor cells revealed that histone H3 is frequently mutated in pediatric HGG, with up to 78 % of diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) carrying K27M and 36 % of non-brainstem gliomas carrying either K27M or G34R/V mutations. The pathological diagnosis was anaplastic oligodendroglioma, and we identified a mutation in histone H3.3 in the tumor specimen. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric brainstem oligodendroglial tumors can include histone H3.3-mutated tumors and have a tendency to disseminate throughout the neuroaxis at the time of relapse. We highlight the genetic aberrations recently discovered in isocitrate dehydrogenase, alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked, death-domain-associated protein, histone H3.3, and telomerase reverse transcriptase and discuss how these mutations lead to unexpected changes in the epigenetic landscape in gliomas. Particularly striking is the discovery of frequent histone H3.3 mutations in pediatric glioma, a particularly aggressive neoplasm that has long remained poorly understood Exon sequencing has identified a mutation in K27M of the histone H3.3 gene (H3F3A K27M and G34R/V) in about 20% of pediatric glioblastomas, but it remains to be seen whether these mutations can be considered specific for pediatric diffuse high-grade astrocytomas or also occur in other pediatric brain tumors The histone H3.3K27M mutation in pediatric glioma reprograms H3K27 methylation and gene expression A lesson learned from the H3.3K27M mutation found in pediatric glioma: a new approach to the study of the function of histone modifications in vivo Pediatric glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is rare, and there is a single study, a seminal discovery showing association of histone H3.3 and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)1 mutation with a DNA methylation signature. Over 70% of diffuse intrinsic pediatric gliomas, an aggressive brainstem tumor, harbor heterozygous mutations that create a K27M amino acid substitution (methionine replaces lysine 27) in the tail of histone H3.3. Mutations in H3F3A, which encodes histone H3.3, commonly occur in pediatric glioblastoma. Somatic mutations of the H3F3A and HIST1H3B genes encoding the histone H3 variants, H3.3 and H3.1, were recently identified in high-grade gliomas arising in the thalamus, pons and spinal cord of children and young adults. K27M mutation in histone H3.3 defines clinically and biologically distinct subgroups of pediatric diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas. Recurrent mutations affecting the histone H3.3 residues Lys27 or indirectly Lys36 are frequent drivers of pediatric high-grade gliomas (over 30% of HGGs). Use of human embryonic stem cells to model pediatric gliomas with H3.3K27M histone mutation. Recent studies on high-grade pediatric GBM have identified two recurrent mutations (K27M and G34R/V) in genes encoding histone H3 (H3F3A for H3.3 and HIST1H3B for H3.1).

This review of the literature aims to describe previous and current treatment options for oral therapy in locally advanced and metastatic NMSC otherwise unamenable to standard treatment. Oral Smoothened (Smo) inhibitors Vismodegib, Sonidegib, and Taladegib have shown to be effective in several trials.  Sonidegib is a new smoothened inhibitor currently under investigation for treatment of laBCC, which demonstrates a comparable safety profile to vismodegib.  The recent development of novel hedgehog pathway inhibitors for high-risk BCC (including oral vismodegib and sonidegib) may represent a paradigm shift towards medical management of NMSC. Sonidegib (Odomzo®), an oral smoothened (SMO) antagonist, is indicated for the treatment of adults with locally advanced basal cell carcinoma (laBCC) who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy, or adults with recurrent laBCC following surgery or radiation therapy.  The acceptable benefit-risk profile of sonidegib, along with a paucity of treatment options and the seriousness of the condition, makes sonidegib an emerging option for the treatment of adults with laBCC that has recurred following surgery or radiation therapy, or in those who are not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy.

Here, we present a systematic study of ultraconserved genomic regions in the budding yeast based on the publicly available genome sequences, in order to reveal their relationship with the adaptability or fitness advantages of the budding yeast.Results: Our results indicate that, in addition to some fundamental biological functions, the UCSs play an important role in the adaptation of S. cerevisiae to the acidic environment, which is backed up by the previous observation. Besides that, we also find the highly unchanged genes (HUGs) are enriched in some other pathways, such as the nutrient-sensitive signaling pathway. To facilitate the investigation of unique UCSs, the UCSC Genome Browser was utilized to visualize the chromosomal position and related annotations of UCSs in S. cerevisiae genome.

573	58ee1cafeda5a57672000014	Are TAD boundaries in Drosophila depleted in highly-expressed genes?	Furthermore, we find that these TAD boundaries are present irrespective of the expression and looping of genes located between them. In particular, Hi-C revealed that chromosomes of animals are organized into topologically associating domains (TADs), evolutionary conserved compact chromatin domains that influence gene expression. Drosophila inter-TADs harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes.  The insulator-like, TAD-boundary-like, and TAD-interior-like regions are each enriched for distinct epigenetic marks and are each correlated with different gene expression levels We conclude that epigenetic modifications, gene density, and transcriptional activity combine to shape the local packing of the A. thaliana nuclear genome. Disruptions of topological chromatin domains cause pathogenic rewiring of gene-enhancer interactions. Our results demonstrate the functional importance of TADs for orchestrating gene expression via genome architecture and indicate criteria for predicting the pathogenicity of human structural variants, particularly in non-coding regions of the human genome. The three-dimensional organization of a genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression, yet little is known about the machinery and mechanisms that determine higher-order chromosome structure. Ectopically expressed roX1 and roX2 RNAs target HAS on the X chromosome in trans and, via spatial proximity, induce spreading of the MSL complex in cis, leading to increased expression of neighboring autosomal genes.  Collectively, our results suggest that TADs are condensed chromatin domains depleted in active chromatin marks, separated by regions of active chromatin. However, Drosophila inter-TADs harbor active chromatin and constitutively transcribed (housekeeping) genes.	no
576	5a760ed883b0d9ea66000019	Is dasatinib effective for treatment of glioblastoma?	RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056). CONCLUSIONS: Intraparticipant dose escalation was feasible, but dasatinib was ineffective in recurrent GBM.  Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.35 months (95% confidence interval: 1.2-1.4) and 6-month PFS was 7.7%. In this phase I study of recurrent glioblastoma patients, the combination of CCNU and dasatinib showed significant hematological toxicities and led to suboptimal exposure to both agents. Dasatinib in conjunction with bevacizumab does not appear to have activity in patients with recurrent, heavily pretreated GBM.	no

Due to the renal glucose-wasting properties of these drugs, they may present with ketoacidosis with only mild elevations in serum glucose, potentially complicating the diagnosis.  Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis with Persistent Diuresis Treated with Canagliflozin. We herein report the case of a 27-year-old Asian woman with type 2 diabetes who was treated with a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (canagliflozin) who developed euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis and persistent diuresis in the absence of hyperglycemia. Canagliflozin raised the risk of amputations and the rate of fractures in the CANVAS trial, although more data are necessary before drawing definite conclusions. The risk of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis seems to be minimal when the drugs are prescribed properly. Severe Ketoacidosis Associated with Canagliflozin (Invokana): A Safety Concern.  However, some serious side effects, including severe anion gap metabolic acidosis and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), have been reported.  At present, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has only approved three medications (canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin) in this drug class for the management of Type 2 diabetes. In May 2015, the FDA issued a warning of ketoacidosis with use of this drug class. We present a case of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to canagliflozin in a type 2 diabetic patient. Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus in Elderly Patients Receiving SSRIs; Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis Associated with Canagliflozin Use in a Type 1 Diabetic Patient; Duloxetine-Induced Galactorrhea; Canagliflozin-Associated Severe Hypercalcemia and Hypernatremia; Vemurafenib-Induced Fanconi Syndrome. Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis in a 27 year-old female patient with type-1-Diabetes treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor Canagliflozin. We are reporting a timely case of atypical euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in a type 1 diabetic patient treated with sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor canagliflozin. Euglycemic ketoacidosis did not recur in our patient after discontinuing canagliflozin.  Euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis With Prolonged Glucosuria Associated With the Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Canagliflozin. In this article, we present a case of a 50-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes who developed euglycemic DKA after initiating therapy with canagliflozin.  SGLT2 inhibitors such as canagliflozin may predispose patients not only to diabetic ketoacidosis but also to prolonged glucosuria. We present a case of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to canagliflozin in a type 2 diabetic patient.<br> We present a case of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to canagliflozin in a type 2 diabetic patient.

640	5a733a672dc08e987e000014	Does temsirolimus improve survival of glioblastoma patients?	RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056). CONCLUSIONS: Temsirolimus was not superior to temozolomide in patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter. The actuarial 1-year survival was 72.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 58.2-82.2] in the temozolomide arm and 69.6% (95% CI, 55.8-79.9) in the temsirolimus arm [hazard ratio (HR) 1.16; 95% CI, 0.77-1.76; P = 0.47]. CONCLUSION: The combination of bevacizumab with temsirolimus was well-tolerated and resulted in stable disease of at least four months/partial response in three out of six pediatric patients with chemorefractory CNS tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Temsirolimus administered weekly at the dose of 75 mg/m(2) did not meet the primary objective efficacy threshold in children with high-grade glioma, neuroblastoma or rhabdomyosarcoma; however, meaningful prolonged stable disease merits further evaluation in combination therapy. Novel targeted agents such as bevacizumab, imatinib, erlotinib, temsirolimus, immunotherapy, cilengitide, talampanel, etc. are helping classical chemotherapeutic agents, like temozolomide, to achieve an increase in overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: CCI-779 was well tolerated at this dose schedule; however, there was no evidence of efficacy in patients with recurrent GBM The addition of temsirolimus to interferon did not improve survival. CONCLUSIONS Temsirolimus was not superior to temozolomide in patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter. The addition of temsirolimus to interferon did not improve survival.	no

6	518ccac0310faafe0800000b	Is intense physical activity associated with longevity?	Our major finding is that repeated very intense exercise prolongs life span in well trained practitioners. Death rates declined with increased levels of total activity (estimated in kilocalories), and declined also with increased intensity of effort measured as from none, to light, to moderately vigorous or vigorous sports play. Death rates at any given quantity of physical exercise were lower for men playing moderately intense sports than for less vigorous men. he purpose of this study was to investigate if jogging, which can be very vigorous, is associated with increased all-cause mortality in men and women. This long-term study of joggers showed that jogging was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality and a substantial increase in survival for both men and women. Light activities (<4 multiples of resting metabolic rate (METs)) were not associated with reduced mortality rates, moderate activities (4-<6 METs) appeared somewhat beneficial, and vigorous activities (> or =6 METs) clearly predicted lower mortality rates (p, trend = 0.72, 0.07, and <0.001, respectively). These data demonstrate a graded inverse relationship between total physical activity and mortality. Furthermore, vigorous activities but not nonvigorous activities were associated with longevity. The capacity for prolonged and vigorous physical exercise, particularly if the exercise is recreational, is a strong indicator of longevity.	yes
17	52f20d802059c6d71c00000a	Is the length of the poly(A) tail involved in human disease?	In human mitochondria, polyadenylation of mRNA, undertaken by the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial poly(A) RNA polymerase, is essential for maintaining mitochondrial gene expression. Our molecular investigation of an autosomal-recessive spastic ataxia with optic atrophy, present among the Old Order Amish, identified a mutation of MTPAP associated with the disease phenotype. When subjected to poly(A) tail-length assays, mitochondrial mRNAs from affected individuals were shown to have severely truncated poly(A) tails.	yes

45	58adbe999ef3c34033000005	Is H4K20 methylation associated with DNA replication?	It seems likely that continued study of the methylation of H4K20 will yield extremely valuable insights concerning the regulation of histone modifications before and during cell division and the impact of these modifications on subsequent gene expression. Aberrant rereplication correlates with decreased levels of H4K20me1 and increased levels of H4K20 trimethylation (H4K20me3). Consistent with this, H4K20 methylation status plays a direct role in recruiting ORC through the binding properties of ORC1 and ORCA/LRWD1. Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in higher eukaryotes. H4K20 methylation regulates quiescence and chromatin compaction. Mass spectrometry analysis of histone modifications reveals that H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 increase in quiescence and other histone modifications are present at similar levels in proliferating and quiescent cells. Analysis of cells in S, G2/M, and G1 phases shows that H4K20me1 increases after S phase and is converted to H4K20me2 and H4K20me3 in quiescence.  Overexpression of Suv4-20h1, the enzyme that creates H4K20me2 from H4K20me1, results in G2 arrest, consistent with a role for H4K20me1 in mitosis. The results suggest that the same lysine on H4K20 may, in its different methylation states, facilitate mitotic functions in M phase and promote chromatin compaction and cell cycle exit in quiescent cells. Histone H4 lysine 20 methylation: key player in epigenetic regulation of genomic integrity.  Intense research during the past few years has revealed histone H4 lysine 20 methylation (H4K20me) as critically important for the biological processes that ensure genome integrity, such as DNA damage repair, DNA replication and chromatin compaction. Disruption of these H4K20-specific histone methyltransferases leads to genomic instability, demonstrating the important functions of H4K20 methylation in genome maintenance.  Both H4K20 mono-methylation and H3K56 acetylation mark transcription-dependent histone turnover in fission yeast. Histone turnover is often associated with various histone modifications such as H3K56 acetylation (H3K56Ac), H3K36 methylation (H3K36me), and H4K20 methylation (H4K20me). These results together indicate that H4K20me1 as well as H3K56Ac are bona fide marks for transcription-dependent histone turnover in fission yeast. Methylation of histone H4 lysine 20 by PR-Set7 ensures the integrity of late replicating sequence domains in Drosophila. However, these studies were limited to only a handful of mammalian origins, and it remains unclear how PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation impact the replication program on a genomic scale. The methylation state of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20) has been linked to chromatin compaction, transcription, DNA repair and DNA replication. Monomethylation of H4K20 (H4K20me1) is mediated by the cell cycle-regulated histone methyltransferase PR-Set7  We find that deregulation of H4K20 methylation had no impact on origin activation throughout the genome. Instead, depletion of PR-Set7 and loss of H4K20me1 results in the accumulation of DNA damage and an ATR-dependent cell cycle arrest. We review the signaling pathways and functions associated with a single residue, H4K20, as a model chromatin and clinically important mark that regulates biological processes ranging from the DNA damage response and DNA replication to gene expression and silencing. Thus, coordinating the status of H4K20 methylation is pivotal for the proper selection of DNA replication origins in higher eukaryotes. We employed genetic, cytological, and genomic approaches to better understand the role of PR-Set7 and H4K20 methylation in regulating DNA replication and genome stability in Drosophila cells.
