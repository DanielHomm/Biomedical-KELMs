14	5318a955b166e2b806000020	Is c-met involved in the activation of the Akt pathway?	Amplification of MET has been reported in approximately 5%-22% of lung tumors with acquired resistance to small-molecule inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Resistance to EGFR inhibitors is likely mediated through downstream activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase /AKT pathway. Simultaneous treatment of resistant tumors with a MET inhibitor plus an EGFR inhibitor can abrogate activation of downstream effectors of cell growth, proliferation, and survival, thereby overcoming acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors. HGF mediated both ERK and Akt phosphorylation. ERK/Akt signaling, but not the Smad pathway, may be one of the main processes in HGF-induced EMT, The MAPK/Akt pathway is indispensable in HGF/c-Met signaling. Inhibition of c-Met activation sensitizes osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin via suppression of the PI3K-Akt signaling Specifically, we demonstrated that inhibition of c-Met activity led to suppression of the PI3K-Akt pathway, thus enhancing cisplatin chemosensitivity. Our study clearly suggests that inhibition of c-Met activity can effectively sensitize osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin via suppression of the PI3K-Akt signaling. We found that a dual Met/VEGF receptor 2 kinase inhibitor, E7050, circumvented HGF-induced EGFR-TKI resistance in EGFR mutant lung cancer cell lines by inhibiting the Met/Gab1/PI3K/Akt pathway in vitro. Here, we report that i) treatment of RL95-2 cells with HGF resulted in phosphorylation of the HGF receptor c-Met, activation of Akt and IκB, translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, and up-regulation of COX-2 mRNA; Our data suggest that HGF possesses chemotactic ability, has anti-apoptosis action, and induces cellular infiltration via the PI3K/Akt pathway; Hepatocyte growth factor-induced c-Src-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway inhibits dendritic cell activation by blocking IκB kinase activity Activation of c-Src in turn establishes a complex consisting of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and c-MET, and promotes downstream activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and mammalian target of rapamycin. Notably, hepatocyte growth factor-stimulated c-Src activation results in induction of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complexes p85α/p110α and p85α/p110δ, which is required for activation of mammalian target of rapamycin, and consequent inhibition of IκB kinase and nuclear factor-κB activation. Our findings, for the first time, have identified the c-Src-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT-mammalian target of rapamycin pathway that plays a pivotal role in mediating the inhibitory effects of hepatocyte growth factor on dendritic cell activation by blocking nuclear factor-κB signaling. Cyr61 siRNA inhibited a second phase of Akt phosphorylation measured 12 hours after cell stimulation with HGF and also inhibited HGF-induced phosphorylation of the Akt target glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha. HGF+EGF treatment increased the duration of ERK1/2 and AKT activation compared to HGF or EGF alone. All these data indicate that a crosstalk between the EGF and HGF pathways in mammary epithelial cells may modulate the development of the mammary gland. Hepatocyte growth factor and c-Met promote dendritic maturation during hippocampal neuron differentiation via the Akt pathway Consistent with these results, HGF activated Akt, which phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) to inactivate it, and reduced phosphorylation of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), which can promote microtubule polymerization and dendrite elongation when dephosphorylated. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of c-Met with its specific inhibitor, PHA-665752, or genetic knock-down of c-Met with short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) suppressed HGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3beta, increased phosphorylation of MAP2, and reduced dendrite number and length in cultured hippocampal neurons. Inhibiting Akt activity with the phosphoinositide-3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 or Akt inhibitor X suppressed HGF-induced phosphorylation of GSK-3beta, increased MAP2 phosphorylation, and blocked the ability of HGF to enhance dendritic length. These observations indicate that HGF and c-Met can regulate the early stages of dendrite maturation via activation of the Akt/GSK-3beta pathway. Involvement of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in hepatocyte growth factor-induced migration of uveal melanoma cells HGF was found to enhance cell migration, and that HGF-induced migration depends on PI3K/Akt pathway. The activation of PI3K/Akt pathway induced by the HGF/c-Met axis is involved in the downregulation of cell adhesion molecules E-cadherin and beta-catenin, contributing to the attenuation of cell-cell adhesion and promoting the enhanced motility and migration of uveal melanoma cells. HGF protects cultured cortical neurons against hypoxia/reoxygenation induced cell injury via ERK1/2 and PI-3K/Akt pathways HGF stimulated both ERK1/2 and Akt activities in cortical neurons. Inhibition of ERK activation completely abolished the protective effects of HGF, and inhibition of Akt activation reduced, but did not completely eliminate the HGF mediated neuroprotection. It is suggested that the neuroprotection of HGF depend on ERK1/2 pathway, and, to a lesser extent, PI-3K/Akt pathway.  Met signals hepatocyte survival by preventing Fas-triggered FLIP degradation in a PI3k-Akt-dependent manner Thus, Met acting on PI3K and Akt ensures high levels of FLIPL, and disruption of this pathway contributes to hepatic apoptosis and possibly to Fas-related liver diseases. The HGF-induced increase in Nkx 2.5 expression was inhibited by co-treatment with the PI3 kinase inhibitors Wortmannin and LY294002, but not by its inactive homolog LY303511, suggesting an involvement of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway in this effect. X-Linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein expression level in colorectal cancer is regulated by hepatocyte growth factor/C-met pathway via Akt signaling Activation of XIAP expression by HGF was inhibited by siRNA targeting Akt1 and Akt2. Activation of C-MET enhances XIAP through the Akt pathway. Hepatocyte growth factor prevents ventricular remodeling and dysfunction in mice via Akt pathway and angiogenesis A significant reduction in apoptosis in the HGF-treated hearts was observed compared with control hearts, and was strongly associated with increased Akt activation. The antiapoptotic effect of HGF was mediated by activation of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway. The protective effect of HGF/SF against the ADR-induced apoptosis was abolished in the presence of either LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3'-OH kinase (PI3-K) or 1L-6-hydroxymethyl-chiro-inositol 2-(R)-2-O-methyl-3-O-octadecylcarbonate, an inhibitor of Akt, thus implicating the activation of PI3-K-Akt signaling in the antiapoptotic action of HGF/SF. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that HGF/SF stimulated the sustained phosphorylation of Akt for several hours Furthermore, ADR-induced activation of caspase-9, a downstream molecule of Akt, was inhibited for at least 24 h after HGF/SF stimulation, These results indicate that HGF/SF, but not EGF, transmitted protective signals against ADR-induced apoptosis by causing sustained activation of the PI3-K-Akt signaling pathway. Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor inhibits UVB-induced apoptosis of human keratinocytes but not of keratinocyte-derived cell lines via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway When we analyzed the signaling pathways initiated by the HGF/SF receptor c-met, we found that the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase and its downstream-element AKT and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase were activated. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase led to a complete abrogation of the anti-apoptotic effect of HGF/SF, whereas blockade of the MAP kinase pathway had no effect. We now show in detached cells a cooperative effect of HGF and FN in the activation of PI 3-kinase and on the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at serine 473. PI 3-kinase activity is also required for the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival responses, as well as anchorage-independent colony growth. Together, these results demonstrate that the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway is a key effector of the HGF- and fibronectin-induced survival response of breast carcinoma cells under detached conditions and corroborate an interaction between integrin and HGF/ Met signalling pathways in the development of invasive breast cancer.	yes
16	51757bbb8ed59a060a00002e	Are long non coding RNAs as conserved in sequence as protein coding genes?	Most lncRNAs are under lower sequence constraints than protein-coding genes and lack conserved secondary structures, making it hard to predict them computationally. hey are under stronger selective pressure than neutrally evolving sequences-particularly in their promoter regions, which display levels of selection comparable to protein-coding genes. bout one-third seem to have arisen within the primate lineage.	no
18	56d1d14567f0cb3d66000003	Is there any algorithm for enhancer identification from chromatin state?	RFECS: a random-forest based algorithm for enhancer identification from chromatin state. However, only a limited number of cell types or chromatin marks have previously been investigated for this purpose, leaving the question unanswered whether there exists an optimal set of histone modifications for enhancer prediction in different cell types. Here, we address this issue by exploring genome-wide profiles of 24 histone modifications in two distinct human cell types, embryonic stem cells and lung fibroblasts. We developed a Random-Forest based algorithm, RFECS (Random Forest based Enhancer identification from Chromatin States) to integrate histone modification profiles for identification of enhancers, and used it to identify enhancers in a number of cell-types. We show that RFECS not only leads to more accurate and precise prediction of enhancers than previous methods, but also helps identify the most informative and robust set of three chromatin marks for enhancer prediction.

22	52fa73c62059c6d71c000058	Are there any urine biomarkers for chronic kidney disease?	Kidney and urine proteomic biomarkers are considered as promising diagnostic tools to predict CKD progression early in diabetic nephropathy, facilitating timely and selective intervention that may reduce the related health-care expenditures. Both blood and urine biomarkers are reviewed in this paper and offer a considerable opportunity to enhance the understanding of the pathophysiology and known epidemiology of these recently defined syndromes. Cardiorenal syndromes (CRS) have been subclassified as five defined entities which represent clinical circumstances in which both the heart and the kidney are involved in a bidirectional injury and dysfunction via a final common pathway of cell-to-cell death and accelerated apoptosis mediated by oxidative stress. There is a strong association between both acute and chronic dysfunction of the heart and kidneys with respect to morbidity and mortality. Both blood and urine biomarkers, including the assessment of catalytic iron, a critical element to the generation of oxygen-free radicals and oxidative stress, are reviewed in this paper. Identification of urine biomarkers has proven to be beneficial in recent years because of ease of handling, stability, and the ability to standardize the various markers to creatinine or other peptides generally already present in the urine. Recent markers such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), and podocin have garnered a lot of attention. The emergence of these and other biomarkers is largely because of the evolution of novel genomic and proteomic applications in investigations of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease.	yes
29	52fb4b462059c6d71c00005f	Is DITPA a thyroid hormone analog utilized in experimental and clinical studies	DITPA normalized the elevated serum T(3) and TSH when the dose reached 1 mg/kg · d and T(4) and rT(3) increased to the lower normal range. The identification of 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) that binds to both α- and β-type TRs with relatively low affinity was unique in that this analog improves left ventricular function in heart failure as well as lowers cholesterol. Treatment with DITPA attenuates the acute inflammatory response and reduces myocardial infarct size. Thus DITPA administration impairs baseline cardiac parameters in mice and can be fatal during in vivo acute myocardial I/R. DITPA improved some hemodynamic and metabolic parameters, but there was no evidence for symptomatic benefit in congestive heart failure The results suggested that DITPA can promote a healthy vasculature independently from its thyroid-related metabolic effects.   Moreover, DITPA and T(4) were efficacious in preventing effects of hypothyroidism on cardiac function and BVD Both T4 and DITPA had beneficial effects on chamber remodeling, which was most likely due to beneficial changes in cell shape and improved vascular supply. The thyroid analog DITPA enhances endothelial nitric oxide and beta-adrenergic-mediated vasorelaxation by increasing nitric oxide in the vasculature.	yes
47	515ac533d24251bc050000a9	Does thyroid hormone regulate calcium transient in the myocardium? 	3-iodothyronamine (T(1)AM) is a novel endogenous relative of thyroid hormone, able to interact with trace amine-associated receptors, a class of plasma membrane G protein-coupled receptors, and to produce a negative inotropic and chronotropic effect In adult rat cardiomyocytes acute exposure to 20 microM T(1)AM decreased the amplitude and duration of the calcium transient. In normal porcine myocardium T3 had no effect on the extent of isometric force generation but accelerated the time course of force development (p < 0.05) and increased the calcium transient (p < 0.001). After induction of myocardial depression by epinephrine exposure T3 accelerated the intracellular calcium transients and reduced diastolic calcium The experimental data showing increased force amplitudes at unaltered amplitudes of the intracellular calcium transient and an even-reduced calcium time integral provide strong evidence for a sensitization of the contractile apparatus for calcium by triiodothyronine hese results indicate that the thyroid state influences the time course of the calcium transient and are consistent with the abbreviation in the duration of contraction that is observed in the hyperthyroid state.	yes
48	517179718ed59a060a00000e	Are proteasome inhibitors good candidates for treatment of leukemia and solid tumors?	We show that treatment with b-AP15 inhibited tumor progression in four different in vivo solid tumor models and inhibited organ infiltration in an acute myeloid leukemia model. Our results show that the deubiquitinating activity of the 19S regulatory particle is a new anticancer drug target We further found that ATO targets AME via both myelodysplastic syndrome 1 (MDS1) and EVI1 moieties and degrades EVI1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and MDS1 in a proteasome-independent manner. Our results suggest that ATO could be used as a part of targeted therapy for AME-, AML1/MDS1-, MDS1/EVI1-, and EVI1-positive human cancers. Previously we had shown the synergic effect of bortezomib and thiostrepton in breast cancer cells in vitro, where sub-apoptotic concentrations of both proteasome inhibitors resulted in synergic increase in cell death when combined as a treatment. Here, we administered such a combination to MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumors in vivo, and found that the effect of complementary proteasome inhibitors reduced tumor growth rates more efficiently than compared with when administered alone. Addition of a proteasome inhibitor to anti-hormonal therapy resulted in a clinical benefit rate of 22% in a limited number of patients with endocrine resistant and progressive metastatic breast cancer. Taken together, these data support the clinical development of MLN9708 for both hematologic and solid tumor indications. Bortezomib has minimal activity as a single-agent in the treatment of recurrent platinum-sensitive EOC/PPC Our study indicates a molecular mechanism by which the sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells is regulated by the level of GRP78 as well as preferential induction of GRP78 or CHOP upon treatment with proteasome inhibitors. Our experiments therefore suggest a novel approach toward sensitization of thyroid cancer cells to proteasome inhibitors. Bortezomib (PS-341) is a novel antineoplastic agent that is well tolerated at doses not exceeding 3.0 mg (equivalent to 1.75 mg/m2), repeated on D1 and D4 every other week. This dose correlates with 70% inhibition of 20S proteasome activity. The maximum-tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of bortezomib in this schedule is 1.6 mg/m(2). Biologic activity (inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B-related markers) and antitumor activity is seen in AIPCa at tolerated doses of bortezomib. Given the results of this trial, it is safe and reasonable to recommend treatment with PS341 on the schedule used in this trial at 1.56 mg/m2/dose in Phase II trials. Particular care should be taken with patients with preexisting neuropathy The successes of proteasome inhibitors in MM are now being translated to other hematologic malignancies, including acute leukemia Such efforts have led to bortezomib, the first FDA approved proteasome inhibitor now used as a frontline treatment for newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM), relapsed/refractory MM and mantle cell lymphoma We recently reported the impact and mechanisms of carfilzomib and oprozomib, second-in-class proteasome inhibitors with higher specificities and reduced toxicities, against head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Carfilzomib and oprozomib potently inhibit HNSCC cell survival and the growth of HNSCC tumors	yes
51	532673c4d6d3ac6a34000009	Does administration of triiodothyronine improve outcome following coronary artery bypass grafting?	Serum T3 concentrations were significantly higher with fewer patients having T3 concentrations below the normal range in the T3 group than the placebo group throughout the postoperative period. Hemodynamic variables, postoperative inotrope requirement, and outcome variables showed no differences between the groups We conclude that although widespread interest has been shown on the use of thyroid hormones in the perioperative period, and the effect of cardiopulmonary bypass on thyroid hormone metabolism widely studied, there is no substantial evidence to justify routine use of thyroid hormones in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Treatment with GIK, T3, and GIK/T3 improves hemodynamic performance and results in reduced cTnI release in patients undergoing on-pump CABG surgery. Perioperative administration of triiodothyronine increased cardiac output slightly and decreased systemic vascular resistance, but it had no effect on operative outcome. Parenteral triiodothyronine given after crossclamp removal during elective coronary artery bypass grafting significantly improved postoperative ventricular function, reduced the need for treatment with inotropic agents and mechanical devices, and decreased the incidence of myocardial ischemia. The incidence of atrial fibrillation was slightly decreased, and the need for postoperative pacemaker support was reduced. Perioperative T3 administration decreased the incidence and need for treatment of postoperative atrial fibrillation.  Intravenous T(3) does not have dramatic effects on hemodynamic variables in this setting as has been previously suggested.  Raising serum triiodothyronine concentrations in patients undergoing coronary-artery bypass surgery increases cardiac output and lowers systemic vascular resistance, but does not change outcome or alter the need for standard postoperative therapy. No significant differences were noted in the pre and post CPB hemodynamics between the two groups for the most part of the study except that heart rate was increased in T3 group. The haemodynamic parameters were no different between the two groups at any postoperative time point. Likewise, density and affinity of lymphocyte beta-adrenoceptors were not significantly different from pre-operative values in either group.	no

Whole exome sequencing is an efficient and sensitive method for detection of germline mutations in patients with phaeochromcytomas and paragangliomas Whole exome sequencing is sensitive, rapid and efficient for detection of PCC/PGL germline mutations. These results from deep sequencing demonstrate a higher mutational detection rate than reported with conventional sequencing methodology. We performed exome sequencing of germline DNA from members of the affected family. Exome-wide analysis identified a novel loss-of-function mutation in the BAP1 gene, previously suggested as a tumor suppressor. whole-exome sequencing has been widely applied in the identification of germline mutations underlying Mendelian disorders, somatic mutations in various cancers and de novo mutations in neurodevelopmental disorders.	yes
108	530cefaaad0bf1360c00000f	Is there an association between bruxism and reflux?	Sleep bruxism is prevalent in GERD patients, and GERD is highly associated with SB. There was a statistical trend towards tooth wear progression being associated with gastric risk factors (p < 0.05).  This article presents a case report of a 27-year-old male smoker with tooth wear and dentin sensitivity caused by GERD associated with bruxism.  The aim of this cross-over, randomized, single-blinded trial was to examine whether intra-esophageal acidification induces sleep bruxism (SB).  RMMA episodes including SB were induced by esophageal acidification.  Chronic regurgitation of gastric acids in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease may cause dental erosion, which can lead in combination with attrition or bruxism to extensive loss of coronal tooth tissue. This clinical report describes treatment of severe tooth wear of a gastroesophageal reflux disease patient who is 54-year-old Turkish male patient. After his medical treatment, severe tooth wear, bruxism and decreased vertical dimensions were determined.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease by itself or in combination with attrition, abrasion or bruxism may be responsible for the loss. The association between bruxism, feeding and smoking habits and digestive disorders may lead to serious consequences to dental and related structures, involving dental alterations (wear, fractures and cracks), periodontal signs (gingival recession and tooth mobility) and muscle-joint sensitivity, demanding a multidisciplinary treatment plan. This paper presents a case report in which bruxism associated with acid feeding, smoking habit and episodes of gastric reflow caused severe tooth wear and great muscular discomfort with daily headache episodes.  The frequencies of RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes were significantly higher during decreased esophageal pH episodes than those during other times.  These results suggest that most jaw muscle activities, ie, RMMA, single short-burst, and clenching episodes, occur in relation to gastroesophageal reflux mainly in the supine position. Nocturnal bruxism may be secondary to nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux, occurring via sleep arousal and often together with swallowing.	yes
132	5710a650cf1c32585100002b	Is Mycobacterium avium less susceptible to antibiotics than Mycobacterium tuberculosis?	The prevalence of MAC lung infection in two inner city hospitals was four times higher than that of TB. Most patients with combined infection were clinically consistent with MTB and responded to anti MTB treatment alone. The triplex PCR developed by us could be used to detect and differentiate M. tuberculosis, M. avium and other mycobacteria in a single reaction tube. Twelve (15%) of the 80 blood cultures were positive for mycobacteria, with Mycobacterium avium being identified in 7 (8.8%) samples and M. tuberculosis in 5 (6.2%).  The antimycobacterial activities of RS-112997, RS-124922 and RS-118641, three capuramycin analogues that inhibit phospho-N-acetylmuramyl-pentapeptide translocase, were tested against clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare The MIC50/90 (mg/L) results for RS-118641 were: M. tuberculosis, 1/2; multidrug-resistant (MDR) M. tuberculosis, 0.5/2; M. avium, 4/8; and M. intracellulare, 0.06/0.5 These results suggest that capuramycin analogues exhibit strong antimycobacterial potential and should be considered for further evaluation in the treatment of M. tuberculosis and M. avium-M. intracellulare complex infections in humans. Mycobacterium avium causes disseminated infection in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Overall incidences of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) were 0.8 and 1.4 cases/100 person-years of follow-up (PYF), decreasing from 1.8 (TB) and 3.5 cases/100 PYF (MAC) before September 1995 to 0.3 and 0.2 cases/100 PYF after March 1997. Because M tuberculosis disease is preventable and curable and yet communicable, physicians should maintain a high degree of suspicion for tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults. In comparison, the goal of treating M avium complex in patients with advanced HIV disease is to reduce constitutional symptoms and improve survival. MAC pulmonary disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of SPNs, even when encountered in geographic regions with a high prevalence of pulmonary tuberculosis. From April 2001 to February 2002, 80 blood samples from patients who were suspected to have disseminated mycobacterial infection, presenting fever and (preferably) a CD4 T cell count<100.0 cell/mL were investigated IL-10 underlies distinct susceptibility of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice to Mycobacterium avium infection and influences efficacy of antibiotic therapy. Clinical utility of rifabutin 1 (RBT), a potent antibiotic used in multidrug regimens for tuberculosis (TB) as well as for infections caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), has been hampered due to dose-limiting toxicity.  Effective therapeutic regimens exist that are limited by the emergence of drug resistance and the inability of antibiotics to kill dormant organisms.  Clinical utility of rifabutin 1 (RBT), a potent antibiotic used in multidrug regimens for tuberculosis (TB) as well as for infections caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), has been hampered due to dose-limiting toxicity. a potent antibiotic used in multidrug regimens for tuberculosis (TB) as well as for infections caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), Clinical utility of rifabutin 1 (RBT), a potent antibiotic used in multidrug regimens for tuberculosis (TB) as well as for infections caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), has been hampered due to dose-limiting toxicity. tuberculosis appear to have different genetic mechanisms for resisting the effects of these antibiotics, with pks12 playing a relatively more significant role in MAC.	yes
134	514b335dd24251bc05000061	Does cortical spreading depression appear in ischemic penumbra following ischemic stroke?	During the subacute phase, the irreversible damage expands into the penumbra: multiple electrical and biological signals are triggered by periinfarct, spreading depression-like depolarizations leading to hypoxia and stepwise increase in lactate. Experimental and clinical studies indicate that waves of cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) appearing in the ischemic penumbra contribute to secondary lesion growth. Analysis of MCA occlusions (MCAOs) revealed a first CSD wave starting off during ischemic decline at the emerging core region, propagating concentrically over large portions of left cortex. Subsequent recurrent waves of CSD did not propagate concentrically but preferentially circled around the ischemic core. In the vicinity of the core region, CSDs were coupled to waves of predominantly vasoconstrictive CBF(LSF) responses, resulting in further decline of CBF in the entire inner penumbra and in expansion of the ischemic core. We conclude that CSDs and corresponding CBF responses follow a defined spatiotemporal order, and contribute to early evolution of ischemic territories. Astrocytes in the metabolically compromised ischemic penumbra-like area showed a long lasting swelling response to spontaneous spreading depolarizations despite rapid dendritic recovery in a photothrombotic occlusion model of focal stroke. Spontaneous spreading depolarizations (SDs) occur in the penumbra surrounding ischemic core. These SDs, often referred to as peri-infarct depolarizations, cause vasoconstriction and recruitment of the penumbra into the ischemic core in the critical first hours after focal ischemic stroke; however, the real-time spatiotemporal dynamics of SD-induced injury to synaptic circuitry in the penumbra remain unknown. We propose that metabolic stress resulting from recurring SDs facilitates acute injury at the level of dendrites and dendritic spines in metabolically compromised tissue, expediting penumbral recruitment into the ischemic core. Although the mechanism remains unknown, SDs show delayed electrophysiological recovery within the ischemic penumbra. Spreading depression-like peri-infarct depolarizations not only characterize but also worsen penumbra conditions in cortical border zones of experimental focal ischemia. We conclude that in focal ischemia, transient peri-infarct depolarizations emerge not only in cortical but also in striatal gray matter, thereby demonstrating the existence of subcortical zones of ischemic penumbra. Spreading depression (SD) has been demonstrated following focal ischemia, and the additional workload imposed by SD on a tissue already compromised by a marked reduction in blood flow may contribute to the evolution of irreversible damage in the ischemic penumbra. While the changes in the glucose-related metabolites persisted during recovery even in anterior portions of the cortex in both groups in the aftermath of the SD, the magnitude of the changes was greater in the penumbra than in the normal cortex. SD appears to impose an equivalent increase in energy demands in control and ischemic brain, but the ability of the penumbra to recover from the insult is compromised. Thus, increasing the energy imbalance in the penumbra after multiple SDs may hasten the deterioration of the energy status of the tissue and eventually contribute to terminal depolarization and cell death, particularly in the penumbra. It is suggested that the limited survival of the penumbra is due to periinfarct depolarizations, which result in repeated episodes of tissue hypoxia, because the increased metabolic workload is not coupled to an adequate increase of collateral blood supply. Transient decreases of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water as measured by fast diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the ischemic border zone are thought to reflect cellular swelling associated with spreading depression. Severely delayed recovery time after spreading depression is thought to represent the ischemic penumbra. One current but controversial hypothesis is that this penumbra tissue often eventually dies because of the metabolic stress imposed by multiple cortical spreading depression (CSD) waves, that is, by ischemic depolarizations. After simulated infarction, the model displays the linear relation between final infarct size and the number of CSD waves traversing the penumbra that has been reported experimentally, although damage with each individual wave progresses nonlinearly with time. These findings support the hypothesis that CSD waves play an important causal role in the death of ischemic penumbra tissue. MCAO also triggers periodic periinfarction depolarizing waves (PIDs) in the ischemic penumbra, the territory of salvage. Here, the effects of SD at reduced flow conditions as encountered in the ischemic penumbra are examined. The experiments illustrate how peri-infarct depolarizations may detrimentally affect the penumbra. In the second series of experiments, periinfarct depolarizations (PIDs) were recorded with an extracellular DC electrode at two locations in the ischemic penumbra for the initial 3 h following MCAO. In vivo two-photon microscopy of green fluorescent protein-expressing neurons in this penumbra-like area at risk revealed that SDs were temporally correlated with rapid (<6 s) dendritic beading.	yes

CONCLUSIONS: A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia. Our results strongly support and inform the clinical use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors in HCL. The therapeutic approach of vemurafenib in treatment-refractory hairy cell leukemia is promising and offers an additional treatment option.  Successful re-treatment of a relapsed V600E mutated HCL patient with low-dose vemurafenib. Recent identification of the recurrent V600E BRAF mutation in a majority of HCL patients has led some teams to evaluate the clinical potential of vemurafenib, a BRAF V600 specific inhibitor in a limited number of refractory HCL patients. Recently, we published the case of an HCL patient successfully treated with a low dose of vemurafenib. We present here the successful retreatment of this patient with a second line of vemurafenib. Our data suggest for the first time that vemurafenib at the dose of 240 mg once a day could be sufficient to maintain a complete hematological remission after an initial induction treatment with low-dose vemurafenib (2 × 240 mg) daily without inducing major toxicity. The discovery of the BRAF mutation has created a therapeutic target exploited by oral inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib. [Successful use of vemurafenib in a patient with resistant hairy cell leukemia]. The frequent persistence of phosphorylated ERK-positive leukemic cells in bone marrow at the end of treatment suggests bypass reactivation of MEK and ERK as a resistance mechanism.CONCLUSIONS: A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia.

Here, we report evidence of the overexpression of DNA methyltransferases 3B (DNMT3B) in invasive cervical cancer and of the inhibition of metastasis by DNMT3B interference. This study was designed to determine the significance of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in DNA hypermethylation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to identify DNA methylation markers in serum for the early diagnosis of ESCC. DNA methyltransferase 1 as a predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic target for chemotherapy in gastric cancer. We examined the prognostic and predictive impact of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and 3b expression in gastric carcinomas (GC) treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. High DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression was found in 105/127 (83%) and 79/127 (62%) carcinomas, respectively. Tumoral DNMT3b mRNA up-regulation was significantly correlated with hypermethylation of multiple tumor-related genes (P=0.021). A regulator of de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, DNMT3L promoter was found to have lost DNA methylation to varying levels in 14 out of 15 cancer cervix samples analysed. The present study highlights the importance of DNA methylation profile at DNMT3L promoter not only as a promising biomarker for cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer among women worldwide, but also provides insight into the possible role of DNMT3L in cancer development. DNMT3L is a novel marker and is essential for the growth of human embryonal carcinoma. Among the DNMT genes, we found that mRNA for DNMT3L was specifically expressed in TGCTs, but neither in normal testicular tissues nor in cancer cells of somatic tissue origin. DNMT3L protein was strongly expressed in two EC cell lines, but not in the cell lines of somatic tissue origin. Positive nuclear labeling for DNMT3a was found only in few neoplasms: 1 pleomorphic adenoma (9.0%), 2 adenoid cystic carcinoma (16.6%) and 1 mucoepidermoid (9.0%) cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our results were not able to demonstrate a clear correlation between DNMT1 and DNMT3a immunoexpression and salivary gland neoplasms development. DNA methylation, mediated by the combined action of three DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B), is essential for mammalian development and is a major contributor to cellular transformation. The prevalence, the prognostic effect, and interaction with other molecular markers of DNMT3A mutations was studied in 415 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) younger than 60 years. The recent identification of DNMT3A mutations in de novo acute myeloid leukemia prompted us to determine their frequency, patterns and clinical impact in a cohort of 98 patients with either therapy-related or secondary acute myeloid leukemia developing from an antecedent hematologic disorder. DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1 and DNMT3b) were also decreased in vorinostat-treated A549 cancer cells. To identify the mechanisms responsible for these genome-wide DNA methylation alterations, we measured the gene expression levels of several DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and their interacting proteins by TaqMan qPCR and observed increased expression of DNMT3A2, DNMT3B, and EZH2 in tumors. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is the primary enzyme that maintains DNA methylation. 5-Azactydine inhibits cell growth by direct cytotoxic action as well as by inhibition of DNA methyl transferase enzyme. Alterations in metabolism of methyl donors, disturbances in activity and/or expression of DNA methyltransferases, and presence of DNA single-strand breaks could contribute to the loss of cytosine methylation during carcinogenesis; however, the precise mechanisms of genomic hypomethylation induced by chemical carcinogens remain largely unknown. Recently, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the DNMT3B promoter region, C46359T (-149C>T), -283T>C, and -579G>T have also been reported to be stratification markers that can predict an individual's susceptibility to cancers. Aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to play important roles during multistage carcinogenesis in various human organs. Thus, tumour subsets exist that display concurrent decreased BRCA1 expression, BRCA1 promoter methylation, cytoplasmic CTCF expression and with DNMT3b over-expression. DNA methylation patterns in genome are maintained during replication by a DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1. Aberrant DNA methylation has been shown to play an important role during multistage carcinogenesis in various human organs. To investigate the relationship between the expression of DNMT and clinical prognosis in adult patients with acute leukemia (AL), the mRNA expressions of DNMT, p15(INK4B), mdr1 were measured in 72 AL patients and 20 normal controls by semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); the ratio of p15 CpG land methylation was measured in 56 AL patients and 14 normal controls by methylation-specific PCR (MSP-PCR). DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 ensures clonal transmission of lineage-specific DNA methylation patterns in a mammalian genome during replication. Overexpression of the major DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 is cytotoxic and has been hypothesized to result in aberrant hypermethylation of genes required for cell survival. DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) plays an important role in the maintenance of DNA methylation patterns via complicated networks including signaling pathways and transcriptional factors, relating to cell differentiation or carcinogenesis. We evaluated the significance of aberrant DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein expression during gastric carcinogenesis.	yes
166	5171833c8ed59a060a00000f	Are chromomethylases present in animal genomes?	"Many plant, animal, and fungal genomes contain cytosine DNA methylation in asymmetric sequence contexts (CpHpH, H = A, T, C). However, at the SUPERMAN locus, asymmetric methylation was only completely abolished in drm1 drm2 chromomethylase 3 (cmt3) triple mutant plants. Although neither the drm1 drm2 double mutants nor the cmt3 single mutants show morphological defects, drm1 drm2 cmt3 triple mutant plants show pleiotropic effects on plant development. Arabidopsis cmt3 chromomethylase mutations block non-CG methylation and silencing of an endogenous gene. The lack of CMT homologs in animal genomes could account for the observation that in contrast to plants, animals maintain primarily CG methylation. Dual binding of chromomethylase domains to H3K9me2-containing nucleosomes directs DNA methylation in plants. A role for CHROMOMETHYLASE3 in mediating transposon and euchromatin silencing during egg cell reprogramming in Arabidopsis. During embryogenesis there is a major switch from dependence upon maternally-deposited products to reliance on products of the zygotic genome. Expression analysis of eight putative tomato DNA methyltransferases encoding genes showed that one chromomethylase (CMT) and two rearranged methyltransferases (DRMs) are preferentially expressed in the pericarp during fruit growth and could be involved in the locus-specific increase of methylation observed at this developmental phase in the pericarp. Natural variation for alleles under epigenetic control by the maize chromomethylase zmet2. Arabidopsis has two types of methyltransferases with demonstrated maintenance activity: MET1, which maintains CpG methylation and is homologous to mammalian DNMT1, and CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3), which maintains CpNpG (N = A, T, C, or G) methylation and is unique to the plant kingdom. Maize chromomethylase Zea methyltransferase2 is required for CpNpG methylation. A cytosine DNA methyltransferase containing a chromodomain, Zea methyltransferase2 (Zmet2), was cloned from maize. The sequence of ZMET2 is similar to that of the Arabidopsis chromomethylases CMT1 and CMT3, with C-terminal motifs characteristic of eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA methyltransferases. We have detected a chromodomain embedded within the catalytic region of a predicted Arabidopsis DNA methyltransferase that is diverged from other eukaryotic enzymes. The 791 residue ""chromomethylase"" (CMT1) is encoded by a floral transcript that is spliced from 20 exons and is present at only approximately 1/10(-7) of total mRNA."	no

174	56cca4da5795f9a73e000034	Is sumoylation implicated in myogenesis?	Sentrin/small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific protease 2 (SENP2) has broad de-SUMOylation activities in vitro, which is essential for embryonic heart development. Silencing SENP2 can reduce myostatin expression and, therefore, promote myogenesis of skeletal muscle. These results reveal the important role of SENP2 in the regulation of myostatin expression and myogenesis. Overexpression of c-Ski/SnoN also induces skeletal muscle differentiation, but how c-Ski/SnoN function in myogenesis is largely unknown. Notably, loss of sumoylation in the Lys-50 site (via a Lys-to-Arg point mutation) potently activates muscle-specific gene expression and enhances myotube formation. Our study suggests a novel role for SUMO modification in the regulation of myogenic differentiation. Although this modification has little effect on SnoN repression of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter and only modestly potentiates SnoN repression of the p21 promoter, SnoN sumoylation robustly augments the ability of SnoN to suppress transcription of the myogenesis master regulatory gene myogenin Our study also points to a physiological role for SnoN sumoylation in the control of myogenin expression in differentiating muscle cells. Here, we biochemically characterize SnoN sumoylation in detail and report the physiological function of the modification.  An essential role of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-specific Protease 2 in myostatin expression and myogenesis. These results reveal the important role of SENP2 in the regulation of myostatin expression and myogenesis. The E3 SUMO ligase Nse2 regulates sumoylation and nuclear-to-cytoplasmic translocation of skNAC-Smyd1 in myogenesis. Sumoylation of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor sharp-1 regulates recruitment of the histone methyltransferase G9a and function in myogenesis.  We show that the overall load of sumoylated proteins present in myoblasts diminishes progressively throughout myogenesis These novel results suggest that protein sumoylation plays a pivotal role in myoblast differentiation and is required to regulate the activity of key targets downstream of MyoD and myogenin. a composite sequence motif has recently been identified that couples phosphorylation, sumoylation, and perhaps also deacetylation to control transcriptional repression in stress response, mitogen and nuclear hormone signaling, myogenesis, and neuronal differentiation. Mutation of these SUMO acceptor sites in Sharp-1 does not impact its subcellular localization but attenuates its ability to act as a transcriptional repressor and inhibit myogenic differentiation. Consistently, co-expression of the SUMO protease SENP1 with wild type Sharp-1 abrogates Sharp-1-dependent inhibition of myogenesis.  Transforming growth factor-beta-independent regulation of myogenesis by SnoN sumoylation. Ubiquitin Specific Protease 25 (USP25), a member of the deubiquitinase family, is involved in several disease-related signal pathways including myogenesis, immunity and protein degradation.   In addition, we show that the skNAC interaction partner Smyd1 contains a putative sumoylation motif and is sumoylated in muscle cells, with depletion of Mms21/Nse2 leading to reduced concentrations of sumoylated Smyd1. Taken together, our data suggest that the function, specifically the balance between the nuclear and cytosolic roles, of the skNAC-Smyd1 complex might be regulated by sumoylation.	yes
176	553a5a34bc4f83e82800001a	Is Ctf4 involved in sister chromatid cohesion establishment?	In addition to Eco1, several other factors contribute to cohesion establishment, including Ctf4, Ctf18, Tof1, Csm3, Chl1 and Mrc1, but little is known about their roles. Here, we show that each of these factors facilitates cohesin acetylation. Moreover, the absence of Ctf4 and Chl1, but not of the other factors, causes a synthetic growth defect in cells lacking Eco1. Distinct from acetylation defects, sister chromatid cohesion in ctf4Δ and chl1Δ cells is not improved by removing Wapl Thus, Ctf4 and Chl1 delineate an additional acetylation-independent pathway that might hold important clues as to the mechanism of sister chromatid cohesion establishment Genetic analyses revealed that Rmi1 promoted sister chromatid cohesion in a process that was distinct from both the cohesion establishment pathway involving Ctf4, Csm3, and Chl1 Influence of the human cohesion establishment factor Ctf4/AND-1  Here, we used Xenopus egg extracts to show that AND-1 and Tim1-Tipin, homologues of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ctf4 and Tof1-Csm3, respectively, are associated with the replisome and are required for proper establishment of the cohesion observed in the M-phase extracts These data defined two cohesion pathways, one containing CSM3, TOF1, CTF4, and CHL1, and the second containing MRC1, CTF18, CTF8, and DCC1 Our results suggest that Chl1 and Ctf4 are directly involved in homologous recombination repair rather than acting indirectly via the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks WSS1 was also found to interact genetically with SGS1, TOP3, SRS2 and CTF4, which are involved in recombination, repair of replication forks and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion The catalytic subunit of budding yeast Polalpha (Pol1p) has been shown to associate in vitro with the Spt16p-Pob3p complex, a component of the nucleosome reorganization system required for both replication and transcription, and with a sister chromatid cohesion factor, Ctf4p Constituents of the replication fork, such as the DNA polymerase alpha-binding protein Ctf4, contribute to cohesion in ways that are poorly understood Genetic analyses revealed that Rmi1 promoted sister chromatid cohesion in a process that was distinct from both the cohesion establishment pathway involving Ctf4, Csm3, and Chl1 and the pathway involving the acetylation of Smc3. Our results suggest that Chl1 and Ctf4 are directly involved in homologous recombination repair rather than acting indirectly via the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. Ctf4/AND-1 is a highly conserved gene product required for both DNA replication and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. Here we show that three proteins required for sister chromatid cohesion, Eco1, Ctf4, and Ctf18, are found at, and Ctf4 travels along chromosomes with, replication forks. Sister-chromatid cohesion mediated by the alternative RF-CCtf18/Dcc1/Ctf8, the helicase Chl1 and the polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 is essential for chromatid disjunction during meiosis II. Saccharomyces cerevisiae CTF18 and CTF4 are required for sister chromatid cohesion. We find that absence of either CTF4 or CTF18 causes sister chromatid cohesion failure and leads to a preanaphase accumulation of cells that depends on the spindle assembly checkpoint. We show here that CTF8, CTF4 and a helicase encoded by CHL1 are required for efficient sister chromatid cohesion in unperturbed mitotic cells, and provide evidence that Chl1 functions during S-phase. In budding yeast, a specialized replication factor C called RF-C(Ctf18/Dcc1/Ctf8) and the DNA-polymerase-alpha-associated protein Ctf4 are required to maintain sister-chromatid cohesion in cells arrested for long periods in mitosis. The physical and genetic interactions between CTF4, CTF18, and core components of replication fork complexes observed in this study and others suggest that both gene products act in association with the replication fork to facilitate sister chromatid cohesion. Our results suggest that Chl1 and Ctf4 are directly involved in homologous recombination repair rather than acting indirectly via the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. Thus, Ctf4 and Chl1 delineate an additional acetylation-independent pathway that might hold important clues as to the mechanism of sister chromatid cohesion establishment.

Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at serine 129 in central nervous system Here we submit evidence that polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, also known as serum-inducible kinase or SNK) is a principle contributor to alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at Ser-129 in neurons PLK2 directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at Ser-129 in an in vitro biochemical assay Inhibitors of PLK kinases inhibited alpha-synuclein phosphorylation both in primary cortical cell cultures and in mouse brain in vivo specific knockdown of PLK2 expression by transduction with short hairpin RNA constructs or by knock-out of the plk2 gene reduced p-Ser-129 levels These results indicate that PLK2 plays a critical role in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in central nervous system. These results indicate that PLK2 plays a critical role in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in central nervous system. Here we submit evidence that polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, also known as serum-inducible kinase or SNK) is a principle contributor to alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at Ser-129 in neurons. Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at serine 129 in central nervous system. PLK2 directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at Ser-129 in an in vitro biochemical assay. Two of these kinases stand out as potential drug targets for novel PD therapy, namely leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) and the alpha-synuclein (α-syn) phosphorylating polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2). Also, due to the dominant mode of α-syn and LRRK2 inheritance and based on current knowledge of LRRK2 and α-syn phosphorylation by PLK2, inhibition of LRRK2 and PLK2 may constitute a potential therapy for PD. To better understand the role of PLK2 in α-synuclein phosphorylation in vivo, we further evaluated the effect of PLK2 genetic knockdown and pharmacological inhibition on Phospho-α-Syn levels in different brain regions of PLK2 knockout (KO), heterozygous (Het) and wild-type (WT) mice. This PLK2-mediated neuroprotective effect is also dependent on PLK2 activity and α-synuclein phosphorylation. PLK2-mediated degradation of α-synuclein requires both phosphorylation at S129 and PLK2/α-synuclein complex formation. Overexpression of only PLK2 increased phosphorylation of aggregated α-syn at S129, which likely is due to increased phosphorylation of soluble α-syn, which then was incorporated into aggregates. Here we submit evidence that polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, also known as serum-inducible kinase or SNK) is a principle contributor to alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at Ser-129 in neurons. PLK2 directly phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at Ser-129 in an in vitro biochemical assay. Unlike other kinases reported to partially phosphorylate alpha-syn at Ser-129 in vitro, phosphorylation by PLK2 and PLK3 is quantitative ( Inhibitors of PLK kinases inhibited alpha-synuclein phosphorylation both in primary cortical cell cultures and in mouse brain in vivo.

In this case report, we used tacrolimus to successfully treat a 13-year-old boy with ocular MG who had suffered from severe steroid complications, including a failure of thrive and osteoporosis.  INTRODUCTION: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease which has been associated with an increased falls risk and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, recognized determinants of increased fracture risk.  RESULTS: Compared to the control cohort, there was no statistically significant increased risk observed in patients with MG for any fracture (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 1.11; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0.84-1.47) or osteoporotic fractures (AHR 0.98 [95 % CI 0.67-1.41]). Further, use of oral glucocorticoids up to a cumulative dose exceeding 5 g prednisolone equivalents did not increase risk of osteoporotic fracture (AHR 0.99 [95 % CI, 0.31-3.14]) compared with MG patients without glucocorticoid exposure. The RANKL/OPG ratio and indices of bone metabolisms are also not affected by THX, although THX increases the levels of IL-7 and RANKL. Both disorders had been controlled for around 15 years by oral prednisolone and a cholinesterase inhibitor following surgical removal of invasive thymoma and radiotherapy, but muscular weakness due to myalgia and an increase in serum levels of myogenic enzymes, mainly ascribable to the recurrence of PM, reappeared immediately after cessation of these drugs, which was done because the patient had multiple bone fractures and severe osteoporosis due to the long-term corticosteroid therapy.  We measured bone density in 36 patients (26 females and 10 males) who had undergone long-term prednisolone administration, and found a decrease in bone density in 31% of female patients and osteoporosis in only 11.5% (three cases). In conclusion, prednisolone-treated patients with myasthenia gravis have an acceptable risk of bone loss if prophylactic medication is administered. INTRODUCTION: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a neuromuscular disease which has been associated with an increased falls risk and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, recognized determinants of increased fracture risk.

207	5540a8d20083d1bf0e000001	Does a selective sweep increase genetic variation?	An East African population that gave rise to non-Africans underwent a selective sweep affecting the subcentromeric region where MTMR8 is located. This and similar sweeps in four other regions of the X chromosome, documented in the literature, effectively reduced genetic diversity of non-African chromosomes a selective sweep that has removed genetic variation from much of the drive X chromosome. evidence of reduced diversity and an excess of fixed replacement sites, consistent with a species-wide selective sweep. recent independent selective sweeps in AGO2 have reduced genetic variation episodes of natural selection (likely a selective sweep) predating the coalescent of human lineages, within the last 25 million years, account for the observed reduced diversity reduced variation or deviations from neutrality that might indicate a recent selective sweep Consider a genetic locus carrying a strongly beneficial allele which has recently fixed in a large population. As strongly beneficial alleles fix quickly, sequence diversity at partially linked neutral loci is reduced. This phenomenon is known as a selective sweep. a local selective sweep or demographic process that reduced variability reduced variation (a selective sweep) the mtDNA diversity, but not the nuclear DNA diversity, has been reduced relative to the neutral expectation of molecular evolution, suggesting the action of a selective sweep Furthermore, the amount of genetic variation after a selective sweep is expected to be unequal over demes: a greater reduction in expected heterozygosity occurs in the subpopulation from which the beneficial mutation originates than in its neighboring subpopulations. Our observation of reduction in variation at both intragenic and flanking loci of mutant pfcrt gene confirmed the selective sweep model of natural selection in chloroquine resistant P. A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection. In these situations, adaptation should commonly produce 'soft' selective sweeps, where multiple adaptive alleles sweep through the population at the same time, either because the alleles were already present as standing genetic variation or arose independently by recurrent de novo mutations. CONCLUSIONS: The severe reduction in nucleotide variation at OsAMT1;1 in rice was caused by a selective sweep around OsAMT1;1, which may reflect the nitrogen uptake system under strong selection by the paddy soil during the domestication of rice. A selective sweep describes the reduction of linked genetic variation due to strong positive selection	no
209	552010076b348bb82c000015	Is there evidence to suggest that triiodothyronine has neuroprotective properties in traumatic brain injury?	Exogenous T3 administration provides neuroprotection in a murine model of traumatic brain injury. Treatment with T3 (1.2μg/100g body weight, i.p.) 1h after TBI resulted in a significant improvement in motor and cognitive recovery after CCI, as well as in marked reduction of lesion volumes.  Western blot analysis revealed the ability of T3 to reduce brain trauma through modulation of cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Twenty-four hours after brain trauma, T3-treated mice also showed significantly lower number of TUNEL(+) apoptotic neurons and curtailed induction of Bax, compared to vehicle control. In addition, T3 significantly enhanced the post-TBI expression of the neuroprotective neurotrophins (BDNF and GDNF) compared to vehicle.  The stimulating effect of T3 on peripheral nerve regeneration may have considerable therapeutic potential. The present study provides evidence that the peripheral nervous system has its own system responsible for the local production of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, which may play a key role during the regeneration process. Although it has been hypothesized that T3 may facilitate neuronal regeneration after CNS injury, the 5'-D2 response to brain injury is unknown. The outcome after brain injury is closely correlated with the intensity of these changes, particularly with catecholamine plasma levels and the severity of the low triiodothyronine syndrome. The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and L-thyroxine appear to enhance regeneration in the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS).  T3 treatment influenced the general levels of incorporation of all treated groups over all days postoperation. T3 effects appear to involve an increased sensitivity of the cells of the injured nervous system to the hormone. T3, when administered over an 8 week period, stimulated axonal regeneration in the dorsal cortex and corpus callosum and promoted healing of the wound in the corpus callosum. The results of this investigation suggest that the use of T3 in the clinical treatment of injury to the central nervous system may be of less value than the work of earlier authors had indicated. In addition, T3 significantly enhanced the post-TBI expression of the neuroprotective neurotrophins (BDNF and GDNF) compared to vehicle	yes
219	52f77f752059c6d71c00002b	Are defects in recombination repair involved in carcinogenesis?	Inherited mutations in genes involved in HR are associated with gene rearrangement and may be a prerequisite for tumor development in some cancer-prone hereditary diseases like Bloom, Werner and Rothmund-Thomson syndromes.  Variants in the XRCC3 gene might result in altered protein structure or function which may influence DSBR efficiency and lead to cancer.  Although alcohol consumption is related to increased cancer risk, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that an intake of 10% alcohol for 4 weeks in rats is genotoxic due to induction of micronuclei. Acetaldehyde (AA), the first product of ethanol metabolism, is believed to be responsible for DNA damage induced by alcohol.  Although efficiency of these repair processes substantially decrease the efficacy of cancer chemotherapies that target DNA, compromised DNA repair contributes to mutagenesis and genomic instability leading to carcinogenesis. damage response and repair pathways are important barriers to carcinogenesis.  olymorphisms in DNA repair genes and differences in repair capacity between individuals have been widely documented. For colorectal cancer, the loss of mismatch repair gene activity is a key genetic determinant. Nucleotide excision repair (NER), recombination repair (RR) and base excision repair (BER) pathways have critical roles in protection against other cancers, and we wished to investigate their role in colorectal cancer. 	yes
231	56c1d841ef6e39474100002d	Is dichlorphenamide effective for periodic paralysis?	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). In one study dichlorphenamide (DCP) vs placebo was tested in two groups of participants: 42 with hypokalemic periodic paralysis (HypoPP) and 31 with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HyperPP), based on clinical criteria. Thirty-four of 42 participants with hypokalemic periodic paralysis completed both treatment phases. For the 34 participants having attack rate data for both treatment phases, the mean improvement in attack rate (P = 0.02) and severity-weighted attack rate (P = 0.01) on DCP relative to placebo were statistically significant.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The largest included study that met our inclusion criteria suggested that DCP was effective in the prevention of episodic weakness in both hypokalemic and hyperkalemic periodic paralyses. For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.  Chronically, acetazolamide, dichlorphenamide, or potassium-sparing diuretics decrease attack frequency and severity but are of little value acutely.   In the HypoPP trial, there were 13 subjects who exhibited a preference (in terms of the end point) for either DCP or placebo, and 11 of these preferred DCP. In the PSPP trial, DCP significantly reduced attack rates relative to placebo. DCP also significantly reduced attack rates relative to placebo in the HypoPP subjects. We conclude that DCP is effective in the prevention of episodic weakness in both HypoPP and PSPP. Diclofenamid has now already been administered for 2 years. It is well tolerated and has suppressed further attacks. Three patients with Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis (HOPP)-associated progressive interattack muscle weakness, who became unresponsive or worsened by acetazolamide, responded favorably to dichlorophenamide, a more potent carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Dichlorophenamide in single-blind placebo-controlled trials, considerably improved functional strength in two of the patients and had a moderate but definite effect in the third. Dichlorophenamide should be considered as an alternate to acetazolamide in the treatment of patients with HOPP-associated interattack muscle weakness who have become unresponsive or worsened by acetazolamide. Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). Whether these drugs prevent vacuolar myopathy, which is a pathogenic factor in hypoPP, is unknown.  Acetazolamide and dichlorphenamide are carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors effective in the clinical condition of hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP). For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis. A second trial, comparing dichlorphenamide with acetazolamide versus placebo, is currently in progress. Despite our better understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders, current treatments are largely empirical and the evidence in favor of specific therapy largely anecdotal. For periodic paralysis, dichlorphenamide--a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor--has been shown in a controlled trial to prevent attacks for many patients with both hypokalemic and hypokalemic periodic paralysis.	yes
244	515ed87c298dcd4e51000032	Do selenoproteins and selenium play a role in prostate cancer prevention?	The selenoprotein-deficient mice exhibited accelerated development of lesions associated with prostate cancer progression, implicating selenoproteins in cancer risk and development and raising the possibility that selenium prevents cancer by modulating the levels of these selenoproteins Notably and in contrast to previous studies, RWPE-1 cells were significantly more sensitive to selenite than either of the prostate cancer cell lines. These results demonstrate that selenoproteins and selenium metabolism are regulated at multiple levels in prostate cells In a low-selenium population, SOD2-Ala16+ men homozygous for SEPP1-Ala234 are at an increased risk of prostate cancer/aggressive prostate cancer especially if ever-smokers, because they are likely to produce more mitochondrial H(2)O(2) that they cannot remove, thereby promoting prostate tumor cell proliferation and migration. Our results support a role of selenium and polymorphisms in selenoenzymes in prostate cancer etiology, which warrants confirmation in future studies. This study provides evidence that SEP15 genetic variation may influence PCa mortality. Additionally, the association of selenium with PCa mortality was modified by a variant, suggesting the possibility that some men with PCa may benefit more from selenium than others, depending on their genotype. We conclude that decreased SEPP concentration in serum might represent an additional valuable marker for prostate cancer diagnostics. The recently completed Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) was one of the largest human cancer prevention trials ever undertaken. Its purpose was to assess the role of selenium and vitamin E in prostate cancer prevention, but SELECT found no decline in prostate cancer. We studied Se levels in whole blood, plasma and prostate of 32 PC and 40 benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients and in the control group composed of 39 healthy subjects. The selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was also measured in the patients' red cells, plasma and prostate tissue. Se concentration in whole blood and plasma in both groups of patients was lower as compared with controls, while in prostate gland it was significantly higher in PC than in BPH patients and controls. Red cell GSH-Px activity was the same in PC patients and controls but significantly lower in BPH patients. Of particular interest was the positive correlation between tissue GPx activity and Gleason score, with this relationship achieving statistical significance among African-Americans (r = 0.67, P = 0.02)	no
246	56e2985951531f7e33000013	Do R-loops tend to form at sites of DNA replication?	Escherichia coli rnhA mutants devoid of RNase HI exhibit constitutive stable DNA replication, cSDR, which is thought to be initiated from R-loops stabilized in the absence of RNase HI. We propose that the organized structure of the R-loop is critical for primer RNA function in vivo with important implications for the RNA processing and DNA replication machinery. The precursor primer RNA exists as a persistent RNA-DNA hybrid, known as an R-loop, formed during transcription through the replication origin (Xu, B., and Clayton, D. A. (1996) EMBO J. 15, 3135-3143). We found that overproduction of RecG protein drastically decreased copy numbers of ColE1-type plasmids, which require R-loop formation between the template DNA and a primer RNA transcript (RNA II) for the initiation of replication. These results suggest that overproduced RecG inhibits the initiation of replication by prematurely resolving the R-loops formed at the replication origin region of these plasmids with its unique helicase activity. The possibility that RecG regulates the initiation of a unique mode of DNA replication, oriC-independent constitutive stable DNA replication, by its activity in resolving R-loops is discussed. We propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome. This would allow replication to proceed while the original block is repaired or bypassed Furthermore, increased RNaseH expression significantly alleviated genomic instability in deficient fibroblasts suggesting that cotranscriptional R-loops formation contributes to the genesis of replication-dependent DSBs in these cells. Transcription is an important source of replicative stress and consequently, maintenance of genome integrity requires the protection of chromosomes from the deleterious effects arising from the interaction between nascent RNAs and template DNA, leading to stable DNA-RNA hybrids (R-loop) formation. Strikingly, we found that attenuation of replication strongly suppresses R-loop-mediated DNA rearrangements in both E. coli and HeLa cells. More importantly, we then show that R-loop formation causes DNA replication fork stalling, and that this in fact underlies the effects of R loops on genomic stabilit R-loop-mediated genomic instability is caused by impairment of replication fork progression When any of these processes are not properly coordinated, aberrant outcomes such as fork reversal and R-loop formation arise and trigger unscheduled recombinogenic events and genome rearrangements.  Many studies show that cells can manage R loop formation with efficiency, and can also process the R-loops already formed in the cell, and by which, the bad effects of R-loops on DNA replication, gene mutation and homologous recombination can be regulated. Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells.  In agreement with this, we found that R-loops co-localize with the ORC within the same CpG island region in a significant fraction of these efficient replication origins, precisely at the position displaying the highest density of G4 motifs.  connection between transcription and replication in human cells and suggests that R-loop dysregulation at CpG island promoter-origins might contribute to the phenotype of DNA replication abnormalities and loss of genome integrity detected in cancer cells. We show that RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) form at sites of transcription/replication collisions and that RNase H1 functions to suppress CFS instability. R-loops and initiation of DNA replication in human cells: a missing link? Stable RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) prime the initiation of replication in Escherichia coli cells. We propose that downstream of a replication block, RNA at R-loops is extended by DNA polymerase I, opening up the DNA duplex and leading to the recruitment of the replisome. Immediately after infection, RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) occur on (at least some) replication origins, with the annealed RNA serving as a primer for leading-strand synthesis in one direction. Here we propose that physiological R-loop formation at CpG island promoters can contribute to DNA replication origin specification at these regions, the most efficient replication initiation sites in mammalian cells. ColE1 plasmid origins of replication and oriK sites initiate primosome assembly by an RNA-DNA hybrid structure known as R-loop. This scenario builds on the connection between transcription and replication in human cells and suggests that R-loop dysregulation at CpG island promoter-origins might contribute to the phenotype of DNA replication abnormalities and loss of genome integrity detected in cancer cells. The multiple cleavage sites on the R-loop substrate match the priming sites observed in vivo, suggesting that RNase MRP alone is capable of generating virtually all of the leading-strand replication primers. Mechanisms of primer RNA synthesis and D-loop/R-loop-dependent DNA replication in Escherichia coli. Alternative oriC-independent modes of replication initiation are possible, one of which is constitutive stable DNA replication (cSDR) from transcription-associated RNA-DNA hybrids or R-loops. Our results suggest that Top1 execute this function by suppressing the formation of DNA-RNA hybrids during transcription, these so-called R-loops interfering with the progression of replication forks. Critical role of R-loops in processing replication blocks. The possibility that RecG regulates the initiation of a unique mode of DNA replication, oriC-independent constitutive stable DNA replication, by its activity in resolving R-loops is discussed. Competition between the RNA transcript and the nontemplate DNA strand during R-loop formation in vitro: a nick can serve as a strong R-loop initiation site. More importantly, we then show that R-loop formation causes DNA replication fork stalling, and that this in fact underlies the effects of R loops on genomic stability.  Consistent with this hypothesis, the 3' ends of the mitochondrial R-loop formed by in vitro transcription are located close to the initiation sites of the mitochondrial DNA replication.  A hybrid G-quadruplex structure formed between RNA and DNA explains the extraordinary stability of the mitochondrial R-loop. Previous studies have shown that the newly synthesized primers form a stable and persistent RNA-DNA hybrid, a R-loop, near the leading-strand origin of DNA replication.  Escherichia coli rnhA mutants devoid of RNase HI exhibit constitutive stable DNA replication, cSDR, which is thought to be initiated from R-loops stabilized in the absence of RNase HI. 	yes

Therapy with mesenchymal stem cells is one of the promising tools to improve outcomes after myocardial infarction. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are an ideal source of mesenchymal stem cells due to their abundance and ease of preparation. Furthermore, several ongoing clinical trials using ASCs are producing promising results for heart diseases. Among the cell types under investigation, adult mesenchymal stem cells are widely studied, and in early stage, clinical studies show promise for repair and regeneration of cardiac tissues.  Accumulating data from preclinical and early phase clinical trials document their safety when delivered as either autologous or allogeneic forms in a range of cardiovascular diseases, but also importantly define parameters of clinical efficacy that justify further investigation in larger clinical trials.  several ongoing clinical trials using ASCs are producing promising results for heart diseases.  Clinical application of adult stem cells for therapy for cardiac disease. Stem cell-based therapies have the potential to fundamentally transform the treatment of ischemic cardiac injury and heart failure by achieving what would have been unthinkable only a few years ago-the Holy Grail of myocardial regeneration. Recent therapeutic approaches involve bone marrow (BM)-derived mononuclear cells and their subsets such as mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), endothelial progenitor cells as well as adipose tissue-derived MSCs, cardiac tissue-derived stem cells, and cell combinations. Clinical trials employing these cells have demonstrated that cellular therapy is feasible and safe.

Among the cell types under investigation, adult mesenchymal stem cells are widely studied, and in early stage, clinical studies show promise for repair and regeneration of cardiac tissues.  Over the past 2 decades, there have been numerous stem cell studies focused on cardiac diseases, ranging from proof-of-concept to phase 2 trials.  Small uncontrolled clinical trials have demonstrated cardiac stem cells as a treatment option for cardiomyopathy. Stem cell populations are rapidly increasing, and we are still in the search of optimal cell types to use in clinical trials as bone marrow stem cells did not show significant improvement in cardiac function following transplantation. Several clinical trials using adult stem cell have shown improvements in cardiac function, however, the mechanism of their action is unclear and widespread tissue regeneration is not evident. As we await results from larger and more prolonged clinical trials, the science of stem cell therapy in cardiac disease keeps progressing.

255	54d9f7894b1fd0d33c00000a	Is DNA methylation an epigenetic modification of chromatin related to gene expression?	"DNA methylation is a chemical modification of DNA involved in the regulation of gene expression by controlling the access to the DNA sequence.  Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation play important biological roles in gene expression regulation and cellular differentiation during development. DNA methylation patterns are characterized by highly conserved developmental programs, but allow for divergent gene expression resulting from stochastic epigenetic drift or divergent environments. DNA methylation plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression.  Epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation and histone methylation and acetylation alter gene expression at the level of transcription by upregulating, downregulating, or silencing genes completely. Dysregulation of epigenetic events can be pathological, leading to cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders, metabolic disorders, and cancer development. DNA methylation is a pervasive epigenetic DNA modification that strongly affects chromatin regulation and gene expression. Epigenetic control, which includes DNA methylation and histone modifications, leads to chromatin remodeling and regulated gene expression. Epigenetic modifications on the DNA sequence (DNA methylation) or on chromatin-associated proteins (i.e., histones) comprise the ""cellular epigenome""; together these modifications play an important role in the regulation of gene expression. Epigenetics is a process involved in gene regulation, mediated via DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and functional noncoding RNAs, which influences the accessibility of the underlying DNA to transcriptional regulatory factors that activate or repress expression. Significant progress has been made in the basic understanding of how various epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation, histone modification, miRNA expression, and higher order chromatin structure affect gene expression."	yes
268	533c3871c45e133714000007	Does splicing occur co-transcriptionally?	Researchers working in multiple model organisms - notably yeast, insects and mammalian cells - have shown that pre-mRNA can be spliced during the process of transcription (i.e. co-transcriptionally), as well as after transcription termination (i.e. post-transcriptionally) The consensus view, based on four organisms, is that the majority of splicing events take place co-transcriptionally in most cells and tissues. Deep sequencing of subcellular RNA fractions shows splicing to be predominantly co-transcriptional We show that in the human genome, splicing occurs predominantly during transcription. Consistent with co-transcriptional spliceosome assembly and splicing, we have found significant enrichment of spliceosomal snRNAs in chromatin-associated RNA compared with other cellular RNA fractions and other nonspliceosomal snRNAs.  The majority of introns in higher eukaryotes are excised prior to transcript release in a manner that is dependent on transcription through pol II s a result of co-transcriptional splicing, variations in pol II elongation influence alternative splicing patterns, wherein a slower elongation rate is associated with increased inclusion of alternative exons within mature mRNA.  We show that the pattern of intronic sequence read coverage is explained by nascent transcription in combination with co-transcriptional splicing Modelling reveals co-transcriptional splicing to be the most probable and most efficient splicing pathway for the reporter transcripts, due in part to a positive feedback mechanism for co-transcriptional second step splicing RNA processing events that take place on the transcribed pre-mRNA include capping, splicing, editing, 3' processing, and polyadenylation. Most of these processes occur co-transcriptionally while the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) enzyme is engaged in transcriptional elongation Abundant evidence indicates that splicing to excise introns occurs co-transcriptionally, prior to release of the nascent transcript from RNAP II Together, our work establishes a system for co-transcriptional splicing in vitro, in which the spliceosome containing the 5' and 3' exons are tethered to RNAP II for splicing. Co-transcriptional splicing of constitutive and alternative exons Current evidence supports co-transcriptional spliceosomal assembly, but there is little quantitative information on how much splicing is completed during RNA synthesis Thus, we demonstrate that the decision to include or skip an alternative exon is made during transcription and not post-transcriptionally Here, we demonstrated that the co-transcriptional splicing of the intron in vitro was blocked by antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) targeting the P3-P7 core of the intron RNA editing and alternative splicing: the importance of co-transcriptional coordination Co-transcriptional splicing of pre-messenger RNAs: considerations for the mechanism of alternative splicing The realization that splicing occurs co-transcriptionally requires two important considerations	yes
284	5544df2a5beec11c10000006	Do conserved noncoding elements co-occur with matrix-attachment regions?	We hypothesized that some of these regions might be matrix-scaffold attachment regions, MARs (or S/MARs). MARs comprise one of the few classes of eukaryotic noncoding DNA with an experimentally characterized function, being involved in the attachment of chromatin to the nuclear matrix, chromatin remodeling and transcription regulation. To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the co-occurrence of predicted MARs with highly conserved noncoding DNA regions in human-mouse genomic alignments. We found that 11% of the conserved noncoding DNA consists of predicted MARs. Conversely, more than half of the predicted MARs co-occur with one or more independently identified conserved sequence blocks. An excess of conserved predicted MARs is seen in intergenic regions preceding 5' ends of genes, suggesting that these MARs are primarily involved in transcriptional control A significant fraction of conserved noncoding DNA in human and mouse consists of predicted matrix attachment regions.

295	54d8d4d1014675820d000006	Do Parkinson's disease patients experience stridor?	The authors describe a patient experiencing stridor and dysphagia with confirmed pulmonary restriction and aspiration following subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulator adjustment, with a resolution of symptoms and signs when the stimulator was switched off. Stridor was not noted during sleep at night. Endoscopic examination of the larynx revealed insufficient abduction of the bilateral vocal cords, although the glottis was not so small as to cause stridor during inspiration.  The stridor was specific to MSA.  Patients with MSA can present other clinical features, such as inspiratory stridor and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). We report a patient with pathologically confirmed MSA who presented with a longstanding history of stridor, RBD and autonomic disturbances but did not develop overt parkinsonism or cerebellar signs. This case illustrates that MSA may present clinically without its cardinal motor symptoms, and that stridor and RBD may be clues to recognise the disease in a patient with autonomic failure. Patients with PD did not display sleep hypoventilation, stridor and abnormal central sleep apnea.  DEVELOPMENT: Autonomic disorders such as seborrhoeic dermatitis and disorders involving sweating, fatigue, weight loss or respiratory problems (dyspnea, inspiratory stridor) are highly prevalent and very disabling symptoms. In addition, they may be the main problem in a particular phase of PD (fatigue, stridor) and condition the quality of life of patients with Parkinson.  . Her dyspneic attacks consisting of inspiratory stridor and cyanosis occurred mainly during the wearing-off time and continued for less than 30 min The most commonly reported sleep disorders were sleep fragmentation (52.5%), vocalisation (60%), REM sleep behaviour disorder (47.5%), and nocturnal stridor (19%). Except for sleep fragmentation, the incidence of these disorders was significantly higher than in PD Six days after admission, dyspnea and inspiratory stridor were noted, and the respiratory distress worsened.  A patient is described with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and severe laryngeal stridor. The laryngeal stridor responded to levodopa therapy, and we are not aware that this has been reported previously. The subsequent clinical course of the former eight patients has been typical of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, whilst the ninth patient has developed postural hypotension, urinary incontinence and respiratory stridor typical of multiple system atrophy.  Although each of five autonomic domains was affected in variable numbers of IPD patients, AD in MSA generally involved more autonomic domains than in IPD, and to a more severe degree, in particular with regard to inspiratory stridor. However, the presence of severe AD, of AD preceding parkinsonism, or of inspiratory stridor, are all individually suggestive of MSA. Apart from dysautonomia, the principal discriminant clinical features that distinguished SND from PD were the early appearance of the following symptoms and signs: (a) severe and atypical progressive parkinsonism characterized by bilateral bradykinesia and rigidity, slowness of gait, postural instability, and falls, and poor or absent response to adequate levodopa treatment; (b) increased tendon reflexes associated or not with frank pyramidal signs, severe dysarthria, and less consistently, dysphagia, stridor, antecollis, and stimulus-sensitive myoclonus, which, when present, are highly suggestive of the disease. OBJECTIVES: (1) To present a rare case of stridor secondary to prolonged laryngospasm in a patient with Parkinson's disease, and (2) to review the literature on stridor in Parkinson's disease. METHODS: We report a 73-year-old Parkinson's disease patient who developed acute stridor due to prolonged laryngospasm triggered by overspill of excessive secretions.  RESULT: Only 12 previously reported cases of stridor in Parkinson's disease patients were identified.  This case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in Parkinson's disease patients, as this affects management. RESULT: Only 12 previously reported cases of stridor in Parkinsons disease patients were identified. This case emphasises the importance of recognising different causes of stridor in Parkinsons disease patients, as this affects management.

Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a rare, autosomal recessive, genetically complex, DNA repair deficiency syndrome in man. Patients with FA exhibit a heterogeneous spectrum of clinical features. The most significant and consistent phenotypic characteristics are stem cell loss, causing progressive bone marrow failure and sterility, diverse developmental abnormalities and a profound predisposition to neoplasia.

332	55088e412e93f0133a000001	Is p100 the precursor protein molecule of the NF-kappaB transcription factor subunit p50?	We previously reported that alymphoplasia (aly/aly) mice, which have a natural loss-of-function mutation in the Nik gene, which encodes a kinase essential for the processing of p100 to p52 in the alternative nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway, show mild osteopetrosis with an increase in several parameters of bone formation:  Proteolytic processing of the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 generates the active NF-kappaB2 subunit p52, which in turn transcriptionally up-regulates p100 expression.  The mammalian Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors, including RelA, c-Rel, RelB, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), plays a central role in the immune system by regulating several processes ranging from the development and survival of lymphocytes and lymphoid organs to the control of immune responses and malignant transformation. NF-kappaB functions as a hetero- or homo-dimer which can be formed from five NF-kappaB subunits, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel. The non-canonical pathway based on processing of NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 plays a critical role in controlling B cell function and lymphoid organogenesis. Processing of NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is tightly controlled, which is important for proper function of NF-kappaB. Processing of NF-kappa B2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is tightly regulated.  Processing of the NF-kappaB2 precursor protein p100 to generate p52 is an important step of NF-kappaB regulation. Targeted disruption of the Rel/NF-kappaB family members NF-kappaB2, encoding p100/p52, and RelB in mice results in anatomical defects of secondary lymphoid tissues. Here, we show that in T cells infected with the human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), IKKalpha is targeted to a novel signaling pathway that mediates processing of the nfkappab2 precursor protein p100, resulting in active production of the NF-kappaB subunit, p52. nfkb2 encodes two members of the NF-kappa B/Rel family of proteins: p52 and p100. The p100 polypeptide has been proposed to serve as a precursor of p52, which corresponds to the N-terminal half of p100. In most cells, small amounts of p52 are produced relative to the levels of p100, unlike the usually balanced production of nfkb1-derived p50 and p105.  The alternative or second pathway proceeded via NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK)-, IKKalpha-, and protein synthesis-dependent processing of the inhibitory NF-kappaB2 p100 precursor protein to the p52 form and resulted in a delayed but sustained activation of primarily RelB-containing NF-kappaB dimers. In one exceptional case, generation of the p50 subunit of the transcriptional regulator NF-kappaB, the precursor protein p105 is processed in a limited manner: the N-terminal domain yields the p50 subunit, whereas the C-terminal domain is degraded Proteolytic processing of the p105 precursor (NF-kappa B1) generates the p50 subunit of NF-kappa B p105 (NFKB1) acts in a dual way as a cytoplasmic IkappaB molecule and as the source of the NF-kappaB p50 subunit upon processing The p50 subunit of NF-kappa B is derived from the amino terminus of a 105 kilodalton precursor Regulation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB involves proteasome-mediated processing of the NF-kappaB1 p105 precursor protein, which generates the p50 subunit of NF-kappaB This effort identified NF-kappaB1 (p105), an atypical IkappaB molecule and the precursor of NF-kappaB subunit p50 NF-kappaB functions as a hetero- or homo-dimer which can be formed from five NF-kappaB subunits, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel The mammalian Rel/NF-kappaB family of transcription factors, including RelA, c-Rel, RelB, NF-kappaB1 (p50 and its precursor p105), and NF-kappaB2 (p52 and its precursor p100), plays a central role in the immune system by regulating several processes ranging from the development and survival of lymphocytes and lymphoid organs to the control of immune responses and malignant transformation	no
342	52b2f09f4003448f55000008	Is triadin involved in cardiac function?	Junctin (JCN), a 26-kd sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) transmembrane protein, forms a quaternary protein complex with the ryanodine receptor, calsequestrin, and triadin in the SR lumen of cardiac muscle. Within this complex, calsequestrin, triadin, and JCN appear to be critical for normal regulation of ryanodine receptor-mediated calcium (Ca) release. Recent studies have uncovered functional roles of both JCN and triadin in the mouse heart, using transgenic overexpression strategies, which exhibit varying phenotypes including mild SR structural alterations, prolongation of Ca transient decay, impaired relaxation, and cardiac hypertrophy and/or heart failure. Triadin is involved in the regulation of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.  Thus the maintenance of triadin expression is essential for normal SR Ca cycling and contractile function. Ca2+ release from the cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is regulated by a complex of proteins, including the ryanodine receptor (RyR), calsequestrin (CSQ), junctin (JCN), and triadin 1 (TRD). Impaired sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca release has been suggested to contribute to the depressed cardiac function in heart failure. The release of Ca from the SR may be regulated by the ryanodine receptor, triadin, junctin, calsequestrin, and a histidine-rich, Ca-binding protein (HRC).	yes

363	56cab4c75795f9a73e00001f	Do U6-associated proteins Lsm4 and Lsm6 interact with SMN?	SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6.  Interestingly, SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6 Furthermore, we present evidence for two separate binding sites in SMN for Sm/Lsm proteins. Interestingly, SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6.  Symmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues in spliceosomal Sm protein B/B' and the Sm-like protein LSm4, and their interaction with the SMN protein. Interestingly, SMN also interacts with at least two of the U6-associated Sm-like (Lsm) proteins, Lsm4 and Lsm6. Furthermore, the carboxyl-terminal arginine- and glycine-rich domain of Lsm4 directly interacts with SMN. This entity promotes the binding of a set of factors, termed LSm/Sm proteins, onto snRNA to form the core structure of these particles.  Toward an assembly line for U7 snRNPs: interactions of U7-specific Lsm proteins with PRMT5 and SMN complexes. In this report, we demonstrate that the coilin C-terminal domain binds directly to various Sm and Lsm proteins via their Sm motifs. We show that the region of coilin responsible for this binding activity is separable from that which binds to SMN. Thus, the ability to interact with free Sm (and Lsm) proteins as well as with intact snRNPs, indicates that coilin and CBs may facilitate the modification of newly formed snRNPs, the regeneration of 'mature' snRNPs, or the reclamation of unassembled snRNP components. Moreover this structure has important consequences for snRNP assembly that is mediated by two complexes containing the PRMT5 methyltransferase and the SMN (survival of motor neurons) protein, respectively. Arginine/glycine (RG)-rich domains in components of the SMN complex interact with Sm, like-Sm (LSm), fibrillarin, RNA helicase A (Gu), and coilin proteins, all of which are antigen targets in a variety of diseases. 	yes
369	513f4892bee46bd34c000014	Does triiodothyronine (T3) has cardiac angiogenic effects?	T3-induced cardiac sprouting angiogenesis in adult hypothyroid mice was associated with PDGF-BB, PDGFR-β and downstream activation of Akt. L-T3 significantly increased angiogenesis and cell survival and enhanced the expression of nuclear-encoded transcription factors involved in these processes. T(3) administration restored TRbeta mRNA expression level in AAC hearts to the control level. Rbeta knockout and TRalpha/TRbeta double-knockout mice both exhibited significantly less capillary density in LV compared with wild-type mice. TRbeta in the coronary ECs regulates capillary density during cardiac development, and down-regulation of TRbeta results in coronary microvascular rarefaction during pathological hypertrophy.	yes
384	54cf449cf693c3b16b000009	Is it possible to visualize subtahalamic nucleus by using transcranial ultrasound?	After measuring thermal effects of TCS and imaging artefact sizes of DBS lead using a skull phantom, we prospectively enrolled 34 patients with DBS of globus pallidus internus, ventro-intermediate thalamic or subthalamic nucleus. TCS had no influence on lead temperature, electrical parameters of DBS device or clinical state of patients. TCS measures of lead coordinates agreed with MRI measures in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axis. Lead dislocation requiring reinsertion was reliably detected. TCS may therefore become a first-choice modality to monitor lead location. Two pilot studies have demonstrated that the intraoperative visualization with TCS and the TCS-assisted insertion of deep-brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes into the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus interna are feasible and safe provided there is exact knowledge on the extent of electrode TCS imaging artifacts.  Peroperative transcranial sonography for electrode placement into the targeted subthalamic nucleus of patients with Parkinson disease: technical note The correct anatomic position of the electrode tip could be indirectly assessed thanks to the topographic relationship of the STN with the hyperechogenic substantia nigra and the nucleus ruber. CONCLUSIONS: Transcranial sonography is easily feasible during stereotactic surgery. In combination with the clinical effects of electrostimulation on the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and with stereotactic x-ray images, it enables the assessment and the documentation of the correct position of implanted STN electrodes in real time.

390	54297ed2289fd6cb07000001	Can siRNA affect response to afatinib treatment?	On the other hand, miR-146a enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation by drugs targeting EGFR, including both TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib) and a monoclonal antibody (cetuximab) These effects were independent of the EGFR mutation status (wild type, sensitizing mutation or resistance mutation), but were less potent compared to the effects of siRNA targeting of EGFR Among the anti-EGFR agents tested, the strongest biological effect was observed when afatinib was combined with T790M-specific-siRNAs The combination of a potent, irreversible kinase inhibitor such as afatinib, with T790M-specific-siRNAs should be further investigated as a new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer containing the resistant T790M mutation. The strongest biological effect was observed when afatinib was combined with an EGFR-specific siRNA The addition of EGFR siRNA to either TKIs or cetuximab additively enhanced growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in all five cell lines, independent of the EGFR mutation status (wild-type or sensitizing mutation or resistant mutation). The combination of a potent, irreversible kinase inhibitor such as afatinib, with EGFR-specific siRNAs should be further investigated as a new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer and other EGFR dependent cancers, including those with downstream resistance mutations.	yes
396	553fb11fc6a5098552000003	Could Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) be effective for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer?	The use of HIPEC after aggressive cytoreductive surgery in patients with ovarian cancer with peritoneal dissemination can be performed with acceptable postoperative morbidity rates. Knowledge of the factors associated with the onset of these postoperative adverse events allows better management of the same and offers the patient a safe procedure These results showed that the association of HIPEC with a complete cytoreduction for recurrent ovarian cancer presents acceptable morbidity and survival There is level-one evidence suggesting the benefit of postoperative adjuvant intraperitoneal chemotherapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer after cytoreductive surgery, albeit catheter-related complications resulted after treatment discontinuation. Studies report the use of HIPEC predominantly in the setting of recurrent disease and have demonstrated encouraging results, which merits further investigation in future clinical trials  The combination of SCR and HIPEC seems to improve survival rate in patients suffering from platinum-sensitive EOC recurrence with respect to no-HIPEC treatments. This result further supports the need of a randomized trial  Cautious extrapolation of data from standard normothermic, nonintraoperative, intraperitoneal chemotherapy and data from Phase II and nonrandomized comparative studies suggest that HIPEC delivered at the time of surgery for ovarian cancer has definite potential The available evidence suggests that a potential survival benefit of adding HIPEC may be largest in the settings of secondary CRS for stage III ovarian cancer and salvage CRS for recurrent ovarian cancer, two time-points representing failure of initial standard therapy. There is much less evidence for a potential benefit of HIPEC for less advanced stages (I-II) and for earlier time-points in the treatment of ovarian cancer (upfront, interval and consolidation) Survival benefit of adding Hyperthermic IntraPEritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) at the different time-points of treatment of ovarian cancer Patients suffering from peritoneal recurrence of ovarian cancer should be considered for radical reoperation with HIPEC in a center with expertise in multimodal therapeutic options. Organ-preserving cytoreductive surgery allows complete cytoreduction with the goal of decreasing morbidity  In recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients, the use of CRS plus HIPEC represents a safe treatment, able to significantly influence the survival rates compared to chemotherapy alone or surgery plus standard chemotherapy  The results of our study indicate the feasibility and the potential benefit of a protocol including systemic chemotherapy, surgical cytoreduction and HIPEC in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from ovarian cancer. A phase III trial to compare this approach with conventional treatment is needed In selected patients with heavily pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer, cytoreduction combined with HIPEC may provide a meaningful OS with acceptable morbidity. Optimal results are achieved in patients with a macroscopically complete resection and biologically favorable disease  HIPEC is a complement to radical surgery/ peritonectomy, which has been shown to be a surgical procedure with high tolerability, low morbimortality, enhanced survival and prolonged disease-free interval in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis for recurrent ovarian cancer  Despite the heterogeneity of the studies reviewed, current evidence suggest that complete CRS and HIPEC may be a feasible option with potential benefits that are comparable with the current standard of care. A randomized trial is required to establish the role of HIPEC in ovarian cancer in the majority of patients with primary and recurrent advanced ovarian cancer, cytoreductive surgery combined with HIPEC can lead to a substantial increase in subsequent rates of disease-free and overall survival  Peritonectomy procedures combined with HIPEC offer promising long-term survival in patients with diffuse peritoneal ovarian carcinomatosis. They achieve high adequate primary and secondary surgical cytoreduction rates with acceptable morbidity and mortality Cytoreduction surgery with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in recurrent ovarian cancer improves progression-free survival, especially in BRCA-positive patients- a case-control study. Survival benefit of adding Hyperthermic IntraPEritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) at the different time-points of treatment of ovarian cancer: review of evidence. Some encouraging results have been reported by the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from ovarian cancer by complete surgical cytoreduction, peritonectomy and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Although standard treatment for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) consists of surgical debulking and intravenous platinum- and taxane-based chemotherapy, favorable oncological outcomes have been recently reported with the use of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). Trabectedin, Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and chemo-immunotherapy may be become a promising therapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) represents a new treatment strategy aimed to improve outcome of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Favorable oncological outcomes have been reported in several trials with the introduction of Cytoreductive Surgery (CRS) and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC) in the treatment of Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer (EOC). Based on theoretical and experimental basis, HIPEC should stand as an effective treatment for ovarian cancer.

408	52b2ed144003448f55000004	Can Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) be used for gender selection?	This testing is used for identifying singlegene disorders, chromosomal abnormalities, mitochondrial disorders, gender selection in non-mendelian disorders with unequal gender distribution, aneuploidy screening, and other preconceptually identified genetic abnormalities in prospective parents.   Although many clinics offer PGD for HA by gender selection, an approach that detects the presence of the underlying F8 mutation has several advantages.  Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for gender selection for non-medical reasons has been considered an unethical procedure by several authors and agencies in the Western society on the basis that it could disrupt the sex ratio, that it discriminates against women and that it leads to disposal of normal embryos of the non-desired gender. In this study, the analysis of a large series of PGD procedures for gender selection from a wide geographical area in the USA shows that, in general, there is no deviation in preference towards any specific gender except for a preference of males in some ethnic populations of Chinese, Indian and Middle Eastern origin that represent a small percentage of the US population.   In response to one specific question, one-third of the couples agreed to use the donor child as a lifetime organ donor and supported the use of PGD for non-medical gender selection.  More specifically, I illustrate how the prescriptions of deliberative democracy can be applied to the issue of regulating non-medical uses of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), such as gender selection.  Private clinics were more likely than other programs to be on either the East or West Coast, list certain PGD risks (e.g., diagnostic error), note that PGD was new or controversial, reference source of PGD information, provide accuracy rates of genetic testing of embryos, and offer gender selection for social reasons. The purpose of this article is to ascertain and appraise the ethical issues inherent to the utilisation of preimplantation genetic diagnosis for gender selection in infertile patients anticipating undergoing a medically indicated assisted reproductive technique procedure. Performance of preimplantation genetic diagnosis per request specifically for gender selection by an infertile couple undergoing medically indicated assisted reproductive technique may not breach the principles of ethics, and is unlikely to alter the population balance of sexes. One possible use of PGD is to perform gender selection for couples whose offspring are at increased risk of disorders that do not follow Mendelian inheritance, but which are substantially more common in one sex than another (unequal sex incidence). Here, we examine the clinical and ethical issues to be considered prior to offering PGD gender selection to reduce the risk of a child being affected by a non-Mendelian condition with unequal sex incidence.  New uses of PGD have been reported in the past year for screening embryos for susceptibility to cancer, for late-onset diseases, for HLA-matching for existing children, and for gender.  This article describes current and likely future uses of PGD, and then analyses the ethical issues posed by new uses of PGD to screen embryos for susceptibility and late-onset conditions, for HLA-matching for tissue donation to an existing child, and for gender selection. The use of PGD for sex selection arouses considerable debate, especially in countries like India that have a marked cultural preference for boys. It is argued that using PGD for sex selection is a treatment option that can be ethically offered to couples who desire to use this technology to plan their families. Another concern is the use of this technology for nongenetic disorders such as gender selection. 	yes
413	56c1f01eef6e394741000046	Is olaparib effective for prostate cancer?	We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib.METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day.  CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.   In addition, phase III trials in breast, gastric and pancreatic cancer are underway/planned, and phase I/II investigation is being conducted in other malignancies, including prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, Ewing's sarcoma and advanced cancer.  In a phase II study, researchers found that the PARP inhibitor olaparib led to stable disease or tumor regressions in patients with advanced breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers who had germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Eligibility included ovarian cancer resistant to prior platinum; breast cancer with ≥ three chemotherapy regimens for metastatic disease; pancreatic cancer with prior gemcitabine treatment; or prostate cancer with progression on hormonal and one systemic therapy.  The tumor response rate was 26.2% (78 of 298; 95% CI, 21.3 to 31.6) overall and 31.1% (60 of 193; 95% CI, 24.6 to 38.1), 12.9% (eight of 62; 95% CI, 5.7 to 23.9), 21.7% (five of 23; 95% CI, 7.5 to 43.7), and 50.0% (four of eight; 95% CI, 15.7 to 84.3) in ovarian, breast, pancreatic, and prostate cancers, respectively. Stable disease ≥ 8 weeks was observed in 42% of patients (95% CI, 36.0 to 47.4), including 40% (95% CI, 33.4 to 47.7), 47% (95% CI, 34.0 to 59.9), 35% (95% CI, 16.4 to 57.3), and 25% (95% CI, 3.2 to 65.1) of those with ovarian, breast, pancreatic, or prostate cancer, respectively.  It is increasingly clear that there are molecularly distinct subtypes of various common cancers, with different therapeutic approaches required for each subtype, for example, the use of the monoclonal antibodies (trastuzumab and cetuximab) in HER2-positive breast cancer and wild-type KRAS colorectal cancer; tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib and crizotinib) in chronic myeloid leukaemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumours and non-small-cell lung cancer and intracellular agents (vemurafenib and olaparib) in metastatic malignant melanoma and ovarian, breast and prostate cancer. Olaparib, one of the most studied PARPis, has demonstrated activity in BRCA1/2(MUT+) and BRCA-like sporadic ovarian and breast cancers, and looks promising in prostate and pancreatic cancers. Prostate cancer cells cotreated with the HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and the PARPi, olaparib, demonstrated a synergistic decrease in cell viability compared with single-agent treatment (combination index<0.9), whereas normal prostatic cells did not. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate. Olaparib, one of the most studied PARPis, has demonstrated activity in BRCA1/2(MUT+) and BRCA-like sporadic ovarian and breast cancers, and looks promising in prostate and pancreatic cancers.  DNA-Repair Defects and Olaparib in Metastatic Prostate Cancer. Prostate cancer cells cotreated with the HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and the PARPi, olaparib, demonstrated a synergistic decrease in cell viability compared with single-agent treatment (combination index < 0.9), whereas normal prostatic cells did not. We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. A phase II study of the PARP inhibitor olaparib (AstraZeneca) for cancer patients with inherited BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations confirmed earlier results showing clinical benefit for advanced breast and ovarian cancers, and demonstrated evidence of effectiveness against pancreatic and prostate cancers. BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease, but current treatments are not based on molecular stratification. We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib.METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 trial in which patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer were treated with olaparib tablets at a dose of 400 mg twice a day.  Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease, but current treatments are not based on molecular stratification. We hypothesized that metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancers with DNA-repair defects would respond to poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition with olaparib. Silencing RAD51 sensitized prostate cancer cells to SAHA and olaparib alone. Collectively, cotreatment with HDACi and PARPi downregulated HR-related protein expression and concomitantly increased DNA damage, resulting in prostate cancer cell death. Prostate cancer cells cotreated with the HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and the PARPi, olaparib, demonstrated a synergistic decrease in cell viability compared with single-agent treatment (combination index<0.9), whereas normal prostatic cells did not.  The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%. Anemia (in 10 of the 50 patients [20%]) and fatigue (in 6 [12%]) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, findings that are consistent with previous studies of olaparib.CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.  Prostate cancer cells cotreated with the HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and the PARPi, olaparib, demonstrated a synergistic decrease in cell viability compared with single-agent treatment (combination index &lt; 0.9), whereas normal prostatic cells did not.

414	5151b8efd24251bc0500007a	Is physical performance influenced by thyroid hormone metabolism?	Longitudinal analysis showed that in Eut men higher baseline FT4 was significantly (p = 0.02) predictive of a lower SPPB score at the 3-year follow-up Even a modest thyroid hormone excess is associated with a reduced physical function in elderly men. Oral L-thyroxine treatment was started and at a 1-month follow-up examination, mental status and physical performance were improved In a population of independently living elderly men, higher FT4 and rT3 concentrations are associated with a lower physical function She had generalised weakness of muscles, cold intolerance and a reduced physical performance. Replacement therapy by oral administration of L-thyroxin resulted in a gradual improvement of the patient's state multivariate analysis revealed that total T3 was an independent predictor of VO2max changes in thyroid hormone were closely correlated to myocardial functional status in patients with heart failure. THR among patients with SCH is beneficial not only by improvement in lipid profile, as well as by improvement in cognitive and functional status, CONCLUSIONS: Even a modest thyroid hormone excess is associated with a reduced physical function in elderly men. Subclinical hyperthyroidism (SH) may be responsible for many cardiovascular changes, including an impaired exercise performance. BACKGROUND: Physiological changes in thyroid hormone concentrations might be related to changes in the overall physical function in the elderly.	yes
431	52b2efcb4003448f55000005	Is Achondroplasia associated with hearing loss?	"A hearing screening program was performed to determine the prevalence of hearing loss and abnormal tympanometry in individuals with short-stature skeletal dysplasias attending a national meeting. Behavioral audiometry, otoacoustic emission testing, and tympanometry were used to assess hearing. Failed hearing screen was defined as hearing ≥ 35 dB at one or more frequencies or by ""fail"" on otoacoustic emissions. One hundred ten of 112 subjects completed the screening. 58 (51.8%) were children. Seventy-three (65.2%) had achondroplasia, 34 (30.4%) had one of 11 other diagnoses, and 5(4.4%) were undiagnosed. 25.8% of children failed hearing screening in one or both ears, while 46.3% of adults failed in one or both ears. 55.1% of adults and 25.0% of children with achondroplasia failed screening. Forty-four children had achondroplasia, and 31 had normal hearing in both ears (71%); 8 failed hearing screening in 1 ear (18%), and 3 in both ears (7%). Tympanometry was performed in 45 children, with normal tympanograms found in 21 (47%), bilateral abnormal tympanograms in 15 (33%), and unilateral abnormal tympanograms in 9 (20%). Fourteen children with achondroplasia had normal tympanograms (42%); 11 had bilateral abnormal tympanograms (33%); and 8 had unilateral abnormal tympanograms (24%). For those children without functioning tympanostomy tubes, there was a 9.5 times greater odds of hearing loss if there was abnormal tympanometry (P = .03). Achondroplasia (MIM 100800) is the most common non-lethal skeletal dysplasia. Its incidence is between one in 10,000 and one in 30,000. The phenotype is characterized by rhizomelic disproportionate short stature, enlarged head, midface hypoplasia, short hands and lordotic lumbar spine, associated with normal cognitive development. This autosomal-dominant disorder is caused by a gain-of-function mutation in the gene encoding the type 3 receptor for fibroblast growth factor (FGFR3); in more than 95% of cases, the mutation is G380R. The diagnosis is suspected on physical examination and confirmed by different age-related radiological features. Anticipatory and management care by a multidisciplinary team will prevent and treat complications, including cervical cord compression, conductive hearing loss and thoracolumbar gibbosity. The report includes information on otitis media, ventilation tubes, hearing loss, tonsillectomy, speech problems, tibial bowing and osteotomy, ventricular shunting, apnoea, cervicomedullary decompression, and neurological signs attributable to spinal stenosis. We conclude that verbal comprehension is significantly impaired in children with achondroplasia. This partial deficiency is probably related to frequent middle ear infections and resulting conductive hearing loss. In order to determine whether these morphologic changes are the cause of the hearing deficit in achondroplasia, audiometric studies and ENT evaluation were performed in eight of the nine patients. Audiograms were obtained in six of the nine achondroplastic subjects (two adults and four children). There was evidence of mixed hearing loss in the four children, but only of sensorineural hearing loss in the adults. We believe that the persistent hearing loss in achondroplasia is not due to sequelae of otitis media as some authors have suggested.  The AA report a clinical and radiological study performed in 18 achondroplastic patients in order to achieve a nosological settlement of the otological impairments. "	yes

498	58ce69cd1f5fb2b734000003	Does HuR bind to the untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs?	HuR is also overexpressed during tumourigenesis and is abnormally present within the cytoplasm, where it binds to AU-rich elements in the 3'UTRs of target mRNA and post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of its target genes. Human antigen R (HuR) is a ubiquitous 32 kDa protein comprising three RNA Recognition Motifs (RRMs), whose main function is to bind Adenylate and uridylate Rich Elements (AREs) in 3' UnTranslated Regions (UTRs) of mRNAs. Human antigen R (HuR) is a ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein that modulates gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The RNA-binding protein HuR binds at 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of target transcripts, thereby protecting them against degradation.  ELAV/Hu proteins bind to AU-rich elements (ARE) in mRNAs and regulate their stability from splicing to translation, and the ubiquitous HuR protein has been implicated in cancerous cell growth.  This is achieved by altered expression of the proteins TTP and HuR, which bind 3' untranslated region (UTR) elements in cancer-related genes.	yes
502	589206fc49702f2e01000003	Are there methods for generating highly multiplexed ChIP-seq libraries?	A method for generating highly multiplexed ChIP-seq libraries. The barcoding of next generation sequencing libraries has become an essential part of the experimental design. Barcoding not only allows the sequencing of more than one sample per lane, but also reduces technical bias. However, current barcoding strategies impose significant limitations and/or technical barriers in their implementation for ChIP-sequencing.FINDINGS: Converting Y-shaped sequencing adapters to double stranded DNA prior to agarose gel size selection reduces adapter dimer contamination and quantitating the number of cycles required for amplification of the library with qPCR prior to library amplification eliminates library over-amplification.CONCLUSIONS: We describe an efficient and cost effective method for making barcoded ChIP-seq libraries for sequencing on the Illumina platform.

533	58dff5776fddd3e83e000008	Is it feasible to obtain DNA read lengths that exceed 30 Kb?	Single-molecule, real-time sequencing (SMRT) developed by Pacific BioSciences produces longer reads than secondary generation sequencing technologies such as Illumina. The long read length enables PacBio sequencing to close gaps in genome assembly, reveal structural variations, and identify gene isoforms with higher accuracy in transcriptomic sequencing.  Third-generation sequencing, with read lengths>10 kb, will improve the assembly of complex genomes, but these techniques require high-molecular-weight genomic DNA (gDNA), and gDNA extraction protocols used for obtaining smaller fragments for short-read sequencing are not suitable for this purpose. The emergence and development of so called third generation sequencing platforms such as PacBio has permitted exceptionally long reads (over 20 kb) to be generated.	no

566	5a67a049b750ff4455000007	Does echinacea increase anaphylaxis risk?	Chicoric acid (dicaffeoyl-tartaric acid), is a natural phenolic compound found in a number of plants, such as chicory (Cichorium intybus) and Echinacea (Echinacea purpurea), which possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and analgesic activities. Although these biological effects of chicoric acid have been investigated, there are no reports of its antiallergic-related anti-inflammatory effects in human mast cells (HMC)-1 or anaphylactic activity in a mouse model. BACKGROUND: Fifty percent of Australians use complementary and alternative medicines (other than vitamins) in any 12-month period, of which echinacea-containing products are increasingly popular. Recent reports have highlighted the risk of allergic reactions to complementary medicines in atopic patients. Two patients suffered anaphylaxis and a third had an acute asthma attack 10 minutes after their first ever dose of echinacea. Fifty-one Australian adverse drug reports implicating echinacea were also reviewed. There were 26 cases suggestive of possible immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity (4 anaphylaxis, 12 acute asthma, 10 urticaria/angioedema).  Echinacea-associated anaphylaxis. A woman with atopy experienced anaphylaxis after taking, among other dietary supplements, a commercial extract of echinacea. Risk of anaphylaxis in complementary and alternative medicine. Several culprits identified including Andrographis paniculata, Echinacea species, bee products, Ginkgo biloba and Ginseng are discussed here.SUMMARY: Knowing the factors that increase the risk of anaphylaxis allows reactions to be recognized, reported and further investigated.	yes

593	5a86fd5bfaa1ab7d2e00003b	Is a CpG island methylator phenotype involved in ependymomas?	Although devoid of recurrent single nucleotide variants and focal copy number aberrations, poor-prognosis hindbrain ependymomas exhibit a CpG island methylator phenotype Although no recurrently mutated genes were found throughout these groups of ependymomas, PFA exhibited a CpG island methylator phenotype, PFB was associated with extensive chromosomal aberrations, and the C11orf95-RELA fusion gene was frequently observed in supratentorial ependymomas.  Supratentorial and spinal pediatric ependymomas display a hypermethylated phenotype which includes the loss of tumor suppressor genes involved in the control of cell growth and death. Supratentorial and spinal tumors displayed significantly more hypermethylated genes than posterior fossa tumors, similar to the 'CpG island methylator phenotype' (CIMP) identified in glioma and colon carcinoma. The data suggests epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of supratentorial and spinal, but not posterior fossa ependymomas. Hypermethylation correlated with a decrease in expression of a number of tumor suppressor genes and pathways that could be playing an important role in tumor pathogenesis. Although devoid of recurrent single nucleotide variants and focal copy number aberrations, poor-prognosis hindbrain ependymomas exhibit a CpG island methylator phenotype. CpG island methylator phenotype-positive hindbrain ependymomas are responsive to clinical drugs that target either DNA or H3K27 methylation both in vitro and in vivo.

The human genome folds to create thousands of intervals, called ""contact domains,"" that exhibit enhanced contact frequency within themselves. ""Loop domains"" form because of tethering between two loci-almost always bound by CTCF and cohesin-lying on the same chromosome. ""Compartment domains"" form when genomic intervals with similar histone marks co-segregate. Here, we explore the effects of degrading cohesin. All loop domains are eliminated, but neither compartment domains nor histone marks are affected. Loss of loop domains does not lead to widespread ectopic gene activation but does affect a significant minority of active genes. cohesin loss eliminates all loop domains"	no

"steogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous bone disorder characterized by recurrent fractures. Although most cases of OI have heterozygous mutations inCOL1A1orCOL1A2and show autosomal dominant inheritance, Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by decreased bone mass and increased fracture risk. The majority of OI cases have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and are usually caused by mutations in genes encoding type I collagen  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a group of hereditary disorders characterized by low bone mass and recurrent fractures. Most OI cases follow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and are attributed to mutations in genes encoding type I collagen (COL1A1/COL1A2).  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder characterised by low bone mineral density resulting in fractures. 85-90% of patients with OI carry a variant in the type 1 collagen genes, COL1A1 and COL1A2, which follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders that are characterized by susceptibility to bone fractures, and range in severity from a subtle increase in fracture frequency to death in the perinatal period. Most patients have defects in type I collagen biosynthesis with autosomal-dominant inheritance, but many autosomal-recessive genes have been reported. To investigate mutation of COL1A1 gene and analyze the relationship between genotype and clinical phenotype in a family with osteogenesis imperfecta Dominant inheritance of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is caused by mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2, the genes that encode type I collagen, Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders of bone formation, resulting in low bone mass and an increased propensity to fracture. It exhibits a broad spectrum of clinical severity, ranging from multiple fractures in utero and perinatal death, to normal adult stature and low fracture incidence. Extra-skeletal features of OI include blue sclera, hearing loss, skin hyperlaxity, joint hyperextensibility, and dentinogenesis imperfecta. The proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains of collagen 1 are encoded by the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, respectively; quantitative or qualitative defects in type I collagen synthesis usually manifest as types of OI or some sub-types of EDS. The majority of patients (about 90%) with a clinical diagnosis of OI have a mutation in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type I is characterized by bone fragility without significant deformity, osteopenia, normal stature, blue sclerae, and autosomal dominant inheritance. Dermal fibroblasts from most affected individuals produce about half the expected amount of type I collagen, suggesting that the OI type I phenotype results from a variety of mutations which alter the apparent expression of either COL1A1 or COL1A2, the genes encoding the chains of type I collagen. Autosomal dominant osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the COL1A2 and COL1A1 genes of type I collagen.  Osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by dominant autosomal mutations in the type I collagen coding genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) in about 85% of individuals, affecting collagen quantity or structure. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a heterogeneous group of disorders of connective tissue, mainly caused by mutations in the collagen type I genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2). Autosomal dominant osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is caused by mutations in the genes (COL1A1 or COL1A2) encoding the chains of type I collagen. In approximately 90% of individuals with osteogenesis imperfecta, mutations in either of the genes encoding the pro-alpha1 or pro-alpha2 chains of type I collagen (COL1A1 or COL1A2) can be identified. Autosomal dominant OI is caused by mutations in the genes (COL1A1 or COL1A2) encoding the chains of type I collagen. ext-generation sequencing technology was used to screen a panel of known OI genes.RESULTS: In 41 probands, we identified 28 different disease-causing variants of 9 different known OI genes. Eleven of the variants are novel. Ten of the 28 variants are located in COL1A1, five in COL1A2, three in BMP1, three in FKBP10, two in TMEM38B, two in P3H1, and one each in CRTAP, SERPINF1, and SERPINH1.  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder associated with bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures after minimal trauma. OI type V has an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance and is not caused by mutations in the type I collagen genes COL1A1 and COL1A2.  Detection of a high frequency RsaI polymorphism in the human pro alpha 2(I) collagen gene which is linked to an autosomal dominant form of osteogenesis imperfecta. Osteogenesis imperfecta due to recurrent point mutations at CpG dinucleotides in the COL1A1 gene of type I collagen. Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), commonly known as ""brittle bone disease"", is a dominant autosomal disorder characterized by bone fragility and abnormalities of connective tissue. Biochemical and molecular genetic studies have shown that the vast majority of affected individuals have mutations in either the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes that encode the chains of type I procollagen.

Complications were categorized as carpal tunnel syndrome, other sensibility issues, tendon complications including irritation and rupture, deep infections, complex regional pain syndrome and unidentified DRUJ or scapholunar problems. The overall complication rate was 14.6% (95% CI 11.8-17.7) including carpal tunnel syndrome or change in sensibility in 5.2% and tendon complications in 4.7%.  BACKGROUND: Although median nerve neuropathy and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) are known complications of both untreated and acutely treated distal radius fracture, median neuropathy after correction of distal radius malunion is not commonly reported in hand surgery literature.  Complications were defined as malunion, carpal tunnel syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), persistent pain, and subjective cosmetic deformity of the wrist.

629	5aa304f1d6d6b54f79000004	Is the consumption of chocolate associated with an increase in cardiovascular disease?	The consumption of natural polyphenol-rich foods, and cocoa in particular, has been related to a reduced risk of CVD, including coronary heart disease and stroke. chocolate has been shown to decrease CVD risk due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. A number of studies have shown that dietary polyphenols exert a protective effect against hypertension, dyslipidemias, inflammation, endothelial function and atherosclerosis, conditions associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Chocolate consumption may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular health, Data currently available indicate that daily consumption of cocoa-rich chocolate (rich in polyphenols) may at least partially lower cardiovascular disease risk. CONCLUSIONS The blood pressure and cholesterol lowering effects of dark chocolate consumption are beneficial in the prevention of cardiovascular events in a population with metabolic syndrome. Daily dark chocolate consumption could be an effective cardiovascular preventive strategy in this population. BACKGROUND The consumption of chocolate and cocoa has established cardiovascular benefits. CONCLUSIONS Chocolate consumption is associated with lower risk of MI and ischaemic heart disease. Chocolate consumption was inversely associated with MI risk. Chocolate consumption is associated with lower risk of MI and ischaemic heart disease. The consumption of cocoa/ chocolate (i) increases plasma antioxidant capacity, (ii) diminishes platelet function and inflammation, and (iii) decreases diastolic and systolic arterial pressures. Chocolate consumption was inversely associated with MI risk. Chocolate consumption is inversely associated with prevalent coronary heart disease: the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Family Heart Study. Daily chocolate consumption is inversely associated with insulin resistance and liver enzymes in the Observation of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Luxembourg study. Collectively, the antioxidant effects of flavonoid-rich foods may reduce cardiovascular disease risk. The consumption of cocoa and dark chocolate is associated with a lower risk of CVD, and improvements in endothelial function may mediate this relationship It has been shown that the consumption of cocoa has a positive influence on a                     number of cardiovascular surrogate parameters such as arterial vasodilatation                     and a moderate decrease in blood pressure in humans.  This study has shown that increasing the polyphenol content of the diet via consumption of F&V, berries and dark chocolate results in a significant improvement in an established marker of cardiovascular risk in hypertensive participants. Cocoa flavonoids exert cardiovascular benefits and neuroprotection.  Accumulating evidence suggests potential preventive effects of chocolate/cocoa on the risk of cardio vascular disease (CVD).	no
631	5a80dbaafaa1ab7d2e000026	Are there ways of joint Bayesian inference of risk variants?	Joint Bayesian inference of risk variants and tissue-specific epigenomic enrichments across multiple complex human diseases. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful approach for uncovering disease-associated variants in human, but fine-mapping the causal variants remains a challenge. This is partly remedied by prioritization of disease-associated variants that overlap GWAS-enriched epigenomic annotations. Here, we introduce a new Bayesian model RiVIERA (Risk Variant Inference using Epigenomic Reference Annotations) for inference of driver variants from summary statistics across multiple traits using hundreds of epigenomic annotations. In simulation, RiVIERA promising power in detecting causal variants and causal annotations, the multi-trait joint inference further improved the detection power. We applied RiVIERA to model the existing GWAS summary statistics of 9 autoimmune diseases and Schizophrenia by jointly harnessing the potential causal enrichments among 848 tissue-specific epigenomics annotations from ENCODE/Roadmap consortium covering 127 cell/tissue types and 8 major epigenomic marks. RiVIERA identified meaningful tissue-specific enrichments for enhancer regions defined by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac for Blood T-Cell specifically in the nine autoimmune diseases and Brain-specific enhancer activities exclusively in Schizophrenia. Moreover, the variants from the 95% credible sets exhibited high conservation and enrichments for GTEx whole-blood eQTLs located within transcription-factor-binding-sites and DNA-hypersensitive-sites.

637	5a723cd12dc08e987e00000b	Can CD55 deficiency cause thrombosis?	 The loss of CD55 and CD59 renders PNH erythrocytes susceptible to intravascular haemolysis, which can lead to thrombosis and to much of the morbidity and mortality of PNH.  CD55 Deficiency, Early-Onset Protein-Losing Enteropathy, and Thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55.  It is caused by the expansion of a hematopoietic progenitor cell that has acquired a mutation in the X-linked phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIGA) gene that results in deficiency of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor structure responsible for fixing a wide spectrum of proteins particularly CD55 and CD59. The clinical features of this disease arise as a result of complement-mediated hemolysis in unprotected red cells, leukocytes, and platelets as well as the release of free hemoglobin. Patients may present with a variety of clinical manifestations, such as anemia, thrombosis, kidney disease, smooth muscle dystonias, abdominal pain, dyspnea, and extreme fatigue. The lack of one of the GPI-AP complement regulatory proteins (CD55, CD59) leads to hemolysis. The disease is diagnosed with hemolytic anemia, marrow failure and thrombosis. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare bone marrow failure disorder that manifests with hemolytic anemia, thrombosis, and peripheral blood cytopenias. The absence of two glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins, CD55 and CD59, leads to uncontrolled complement activation that accounts for hemolysis and other PNH manifestations. RESULTS: CD55 and/or CD59 deficiencies were found in 1.6% (2/127) of patients with primary BCS, 1.0% (1/100) of non-malignant and non-cirrhotic patients with PVT, and 4.7% (4/85) of cirrhotic patients with PVT. Data of this study indicate that the PNH defect as detected with CD55, CD59, and CD16 is not an important cause of intra-abdominal thrombosis in northwestern India. PNH testing of red blood cells revealed a CD55 and CD59 deficiency consistent with PNH in both cases. The systemic complications typically associated with thrombosis were not observed for the following several months with early conservative treatments including eculizumab. Deficiency of the GPI-anchored complement inhibitors CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes leads to intravascular hemolysis upon complement activation. Apart from hemolysis, another prominent feature is a highly increased risk of thrombosis. Genetic reconstitution of CD55 or treatment with a complement-inhibitory therapeutic antibody reversed abnormal complement activation.<br><b>CONCLUSIONS</b>: CD55 deficiency with hyperactivation of complement, angiopathic thrombosis, and protein-losing enteropathy (the CHAPLE syndrome) is caused by abnormal complement activation due to biallelic loss-of-function mutations in CD55.

15	54c12fd1f693c3b16b000001	Does the histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) interact with triadin?	The HRC effects on RyR may be regulated by the Ca(2+)-sensitivity of its interaction with triadin. In rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscles, HRC binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes via triadin, a junctional SR protein.  HRC may play a key role in the regulation of SR Ca cycling through its direct interactions with SERCA2 and triadin, mediating a fine cross talk between SR Ca uptake and release in the heart. Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is located in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that binds to both triadin (TRN) and SERCA affecting Ca(2+) cycling in the SR. HRC is a SR luminal Ca(2+) binding protein known to associate with both triadin and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, and may thus mediate the crosstalk between SR Ca(2+) uptake and release. The histidine-rich Ca(2+) binding protein (HRC) is a high capacity Ca(2+) binding protein in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Because HRC appears to interact directly with triadin, HRC may play a role in the regulation of Ca(2+) release during excitation-contraction coupling. In the present study, we have performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments and show that HRC binds directly to triadin, which is an integral membrane protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. A direct binding of HRC (histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding protein) to triadin, the main transmembrane protein of the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of skeletal muscle, seems well supported. The present study documents the binding interaction of skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) transmembrane protein triadin with peripheral histidine-rich, Ca(2+)-binding protein (HCP). In addition, the intra-luminal histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) has been shown to interact with both SERCA2a and triadin. Notably, there is physical and direct interaction between these protein players, mediating a fine-cross talk between SR Ca-uptake, storage and release. The histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (HRCBP) is expressed in the junctional SR, the site of calcium release from the SR. HRCBP is expressed exclusively in muscle tissues and binds calcium with low affinity and high capacity. In addition, HRCBP interacts with triadin, a protein associated with the ryanodine receptor and thought to be involved in calcium release. Its calcium binding properties, localization to the SR, and interaction with triadin suggest that HRCBP is involved in calcium handling by the SR. Using a fusion protein binding assay, we further identified the histidine-rich acidic repeats of HRC as responsible for the binding of HRC to triadin.  The HRC binding domain of triadin was also localized by fusion protein binding assay to the lumenal region containing the KEKE motif that was previously shown to be involved in the binding of triadin to calsequestrin. Notably, the interaction of HRC and triadin is Ca(2+)-sensitive. Our data suggest that HRC may play a role in the regulation of Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by interaction with triadin. Further support for colocalization of HRC with triadin cytoplasmic domain is provided here by experiments of mild tryptic digestion of tightly sealed TC vesicles. We demonstrate that HRC can be isolated as a complex with triadin, following equilibrium sucrose-density centrifugation in the presence of mM Ca(2+). Here, we characterized the COOH-terminal portion of rabbit HRC, expressed and purified as a fusion protein (HRC(569-852)), with respect to Ca(2+)-binding properties, and to the interaction with triadin on blots, as a function of the concentration of Ca(2+). Our results identify the polyglutamic stretch near the COOH terminus, as the Ca(2+)-binding site responsible, both for the acceleration in mobility of HRC on SDS-PAGE in the presence of millimolar concentrations of Ca(2+), and for the enhancement by high Ca(2+) of the interaction between HRC and triadin cytoplasmic segment. In addition to providing further evidence that HCP coenriches with RyR1, FKBP-12, triadin and calsequestrin (CS) in sucrose-density-purified TC vesicles, using specific polyclonal antibody, we show it to be expressed as a single protein species, both in fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibers, and to identically localize to the I-band. Colocalization of HCP and triadin at junctional triads is supported by the overlapping staining pattern using monoclonal antibodies to triadin. We show a specific binding interaction between digoxigenin-HCP and triadin, using ligand blot techniques. Suggesting that triadin dually interacts with HCP and with CS, at distinct sites, we have found that triadin-CS interaction in overlays does not require the presence of Ca2+. These differential effects form the basis for the hypothesis that HCP anchors to the junctional membrane domain of the SR, through binding to triadin short cytoplasmic domain at the NH2 terminus. Although the function of this interaction, as such, is not well understood, it seems of potential biological interest within the more general context of the structural-functional role of triadin at the triadic junction in skeletal muscle. BACKGROUND: Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is located in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that binds to both triadin (TRN) and SERCA affecting Ca(2+) cycling in the SR. Chronic overexpression of HRC that may disrupt intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis is implicated in pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. Interaction of HRC (histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding protein) and triadin in the lumen of sarcoplasmic reticulum. The histidine-rich Ca-binding protein (HRC) is an SR component that binds to triadin and may affect Ca release through the ryanodine receptor.

18	532f0c4ed6d3ac6a3400002e	Are patients with marfan syndrome at increased risk of arrhythmias?	Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a variable, autosomal-dominant disorder of the connective tissue. In MFS serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) can occur. Marfan's patients carry increased risk for cardiac arrhythmias.  Ventricular arrhythmias were present in 21% and were associated with increased left ventricular size, mitral valve prolapse, and abnormalities of repolarization. Cardiac complications are rare in young patients with Marfan syndrome receiving medical therapy and close clinical follow-up. Sudden death still occurs, and appears more common in patients with a dilated left ventricle. Left ventricular dilation may predispose to alterations of repolarization and fatal ventricular arrhythmias.	yes
20	52b2f1724003448f5500000b	Is JTV519 (K201) a potential drug for the prevention of arrhythmias?	We compared the suppressive effect of K201 (JTV519), a multiple-channel blocker and cardiac ryanodine receptor-calcium release channel (RyR2) stabilizer, with that of diltiazem, a Ca(2+ )channel blocker, in 2 studies of isoproterenol-induced (n = 30) and ischemic-reperfusion-induced VAs (n = 38) in rats.  After administration of isoproterenol under Ca(2+) loading, fatal VA frequently occurred in the vehicle (9 of 10 animals, 90%) and diltiazem (8 of 10, 80%) groups, and K201 significantly suppressed the incidences of arrhythmia and mortality (2 of 10, 20%). In the reperfusion study, the incidence and the time until occurrence of reperfusion-induced VA and mortality were significantly suppressed in the K201 (2 of 15 animals, 13%) and diltiazem (1 of 9 animals, 11%) groups compared to the vehicle group (8 of 14 animals, 57%).  K201 markedly suppressed both the isoproterenol-induced and the reperfusion-induced VAs, whereas diltiazem did not suppress the isoproterenol-induced VA. JTV519 (K201) is a newly developed 1,4-benzothiazepine drug with antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective properties. It appears to be very effective in not only preventing but also in reversing the characteristic myocardial changes and preventing lethal arrhythmias. The novel antiarrhythmic drug K201 (4-[3-{1-(4-benzyl)piperidinyl}propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzothiazepine monohydrochloride) is currently in development for treatment of atrial fibrillation. K201 not only controls intracellular calcium release by the ryanodine receptors, but also possesses a ventricular action that might predispose to torsade de pointes arrhythmias.  The RyR is currently used as a therapeutic target in malignant hyperthermia where dantrolene is effective and to relieve ventricular arrhythmia, with the use of JTV519 and flecainide. Finally, KN-3 and JTV519, two compounds that stabilize RyR2 in the closed state, prevent the induction of triggered activity and suppress the inducibility of sustained AF.  JTV-519 greatly reduced the frequency of ouabain-induced arrhythmogenic events. Stabilization of RyR2 by JTV-519 effectively reduces these triggered arrhythmias. These findings may reveal the anti-arrhythmic potential of K201. The preferential ryanodine receptor stabilizer (K201) possesses antiarrhythmic effects through calcium regulation.  The drug K201 (JTV-519) increases inotropy and suppresses arrhythmias in failing hearts, but the effects of K201 on normal hearts is unknown.  K201 fails to prevent DADs in RyR2(R4496C+/-) myocytes and ventricular arrhythmias in RyR2(R4496C+/-) mice In vivo administration of K201 failed to prevent induction of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) in RyR2(R4496C+/-) mice. The 1,4-benzothiazepine JTV519, which increases the binding affinity of calstabin-2 for RyR2, inhibited the diastolic SR Ca2+ leak, monophasic action potential alternans and triggered arrhythmias. In arrhythmias, the calstabin2 stabiliser JTV519 did not prevent arrhythmias in calstabin2-/- mice, but reduced the arrhythmias in calstabin2+/- mice, illustrating the antiarrhythmic potential of stabilising calstablin2.  In three models of arrhythmias, the calstabin2 stabiliser JTV519 did not prevent arrhythmias in calstabin2(-/-) mice, but reduced the arrhythmias in calstabin2(+/-) mice, illustrating the antiarrhythmic potential of stabilising calstabin2.  A derivative of 1,4-benzothiazepine (JTV519) increased the affinity of calstabin2 for RyR2, which stabilized the closed state of RyR2 and prevented the Ca2+ leak that triggers arrhythmias.  JTV-519 had significant protective effects on atrial fibrillation in the canine sterile pericarditis model, mainly by increasing effective refractory period, suggesting that it may have potential as a novel antiarrhythmic agent for atrial fibrillation. JTV-519 significantly decreased the mean number of sustained atrial fibrillation episodes (from 4.2 +/- 2.9 to 0 +/- 0, P < 0.01).  We conclude that JTV-519 can exert antiarrhythmic effects against AF by inhibiting repolarizing K(+) currents. The drug may be useful for the treatment of AF in patients with ischaemic heart disease.	yes

29	54f49e56d0d681a040000004	Is there an association between presenteeism and depression?	"Presenteeism was positively associated with severity of depression (Health and Work Performance Questionnaire, P < 0.0001; WPAI, P < 0.0001). Statistically significant correlations (0.32-0.53) were found between presenteeism and increasing disability, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life.  Presenteeism was associated with increasing fatigue, depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life. Factors with less contribution to presenteeism included physical limitations, depression or anxiety, inadequate job training, and problems with supervisors and coworkers.  BACKGROUND: Subthreshold depression is highly prevalent in the general population and causes great loss to society especially in the form of reduced productivity while at work (presenteeism). Two major causes of worker presenteeism (reduced on-the-job productivity as a result of health problems) are musculoskeletal pain and mental health issues, particularly depression.   Pain and depression were significantly associated with presenteeism. Pr Survey adjusted multivariable logistic regression assessed classification of 12-month, depression-related presenteeism on the basis of socio-demographic, financial, work and health factors.  RESULTS: The LPT from absenteeism and presenteeism (reduced performance while present at work) was significantly higher among the MDD group. BACKGROUND: Depression is reported to be a major cause of illness-related sub-optimal work performance (presenteeism).  BACKGROUND: It is amply documented that mood disorders adversely affect job satisfaction, workforce productivity, and absenteeism/presenteeism.  The difference in productivity loss due to impaired presenteeism was significantly different between the two groups, but the productivity loss due to absenteeism was not.  Disease activity (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.11-9.48) and depression (OR 3.22, 95% CI 1.22-8.48) were associated with absenteeism, while depression (OR 5.69, 95% CI 1.77-18.27, disease activity (OR 3.97, 95% CI 1.76-8.98), anxiety (OR 3.90, 95% CI 1.83-8.31), self-efficacy (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.58-0.86), and increasing age (OR 1.04 per year, 95% CI 1.00-1.08) were associated with presenteeism.  Depression, in particular, appears to be associated with employment, absenteeism, and presenteeism, and should therefore be prioritized in clinical practice. Depression frequently causes unemployment, absenteeism, and presenteeism, which results in significantly reduced productivity. Presenteeism and absenteeism were significantly worse for the depression group at each time point (p < or = .001). In cross-sectional models, presenteeism was associated with more severe depression symptoms, poorer general physical health, psychologically demanding work, the interaction ofpsychologically demanding work with depression, and less job control (r2 range = .33-.54). Chronic conditions such as depression/anxiety, obesity, arthritis, and back/neck pain are especially important causes of productivity loss. Comorbidities have significant non-additive effects on both absenteeism and presenteeism. RESULTS: At baseline, all presenteeism measures were sensitive to differences between those with (N=69) and without (N=363) depression/anxiety. Depression and anxiety were more consistently associated with ""presenteeism"" (that is, lost productivity while at work) than with absenteeism, whether this was measured by cutback days or by direct questionnaires. RESULTS: Substantial research exists about anxiety and depression costs, such as performance and productivity, absenteeism, presenteeism, disability, physical disability exacerbation, mental health treatment, increased medical care costs, exacerbating of physical illness, and studies of mental health care limitations and cost-offset. The author discusses the etiology and potential solutions for managing this new component in the productivity equation and in addressing depression, the major contributor to presenteeism. For employees who are currently depressed, recent research evidence has demonstrated that pharmacotherapy can have a dramatic and positive effect on lost productivity, absenteeism, and presenteeism. Among participants who were still employed, those with depression had significantly more job turnover, presenteeism, and absenteeism.  Only depression affected both absenteeism-presenteeism and critical incidents.  CONCLUSIONS: Depressive disorders in the workplace persist over time and have a major effect on work performance, most notably on ""presenteeism,"" or reduced effectiveness in the workplace.  The negative effects of depression include those on patients' occupational functioning, including absenteeism, presenteeism, and reduced opportunities for educational and work success.  The remitted group demonstrated a significant improvement in productivity (particularly presenteeism) when compared with the new visit group (Z = -3.29, p = 0.001). Depression in workers leads to significant absenteeism, ""presenteeism"" (diminished capacity due to illness while still present at work), and significantly increased medical expenses in addition to the costs of psychiatric care.  Significant predictors of presenteeism and activity impairment at follow-up (controlled for gender, age, spondyloarthritis subgroups and presenteeism at baseline) were presenteeism at baseline, poor quality of life, worse disease activity, decreased physical function, lower self-efficacy pain and symptom, higher scores of anxiety, depression, smoking and low education level, and for activity impairment also female sex.  "" Pain and depression were significantly associated with presenteeism. Only depression affected both absenteeism-presenteeism and critical incidents. Factors with less contribution to presenteeism included physical limitations, depression or anxiety, inadequate job training, and problems with supervisors and coworkers."	yes

54	5a468785966455904c00000d	Does RNA polymerase II have RNA cleavage activity?	In addition to RNA synthesis, multisubunit RNA polymerases (msRNAPs) support enzymatic reactions such as intrinsic transcript cleavage. msRNAP active sites from different species appear to exhibit differential intrinsic transcript cleavage efficiency and have likely evolved to allow fine-tuning of the transcription process. Here we show that a single amino-acid substitution in the trigger loop (TL) of Saccharomyces RNAP II, Rpb1 H1085Y, engenders a gain of intrinsic cleavage activity where the substituted tyrosine appears to participate in acid-base chemistry at alkaline pH for both intrinsic cleavage and nucleotidyl transfer.  The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex. The transcription factor TFIIS zinc ribbon dipeptide Asp-Glu is critical for stimulation of elongation and RNA cleavage by RNA polymerase II By site-directed mutagenesis, we have demonstrated that invariant residues Asp-261 and Glu-262 of the nucleic acid-binding TFIIS Zn ribbon are critical for stimulation of both elongation and RNA cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II. Complexes of yeast RNA polymerase II and RNA are substrates for TFIIS-induced RNA cleavage. RNA in such RNA-RNA polymerase complexes undergoes reactions previously thought to be unique to nascent RNA in ternary complexes with DNA, including TFIIS-dependent cleavage and elongation by 3'-terminal addition of NMP from NTP. Nascent RNA cleavage by arrested RNA polymerase II does not require upstream translocation of the elongation complex on DNA. Here we show that in the presence of SII and nucleotides, transcript cleavage is detected during SII-dependent elongation but not during SII-independent transcription.  under typical transcription conditions, SII is necessary but insufficient to activate RNA cleavage. RNA cleavage could serve to move RNA polymerase II away from the transcriptional impediment and/or permit RNA polymerase II multiple attempts at RNA elongation. SII is an RNA polymerase II-binding protein that stimulates transcription elongation and also activates nascent transcript cleavage by RNA polymerase II in elongation complexes in vitro The RNA polymerase II elongation complex. Factor-dependent transcription elongation involves nascent RNA cleavage. Cleavage was not restricted to an elongation complex arrested at this particular site, showing that nascent RNA hydrolysis is a general property of RNA polymerase II elongation complexes. Elongation factor SII (also known as TFIIS) is an RNA polymerase II binding protein that allows bypass of template arrest sites by activating a nascent RNA cleavage reaction. During gene transcription, the RNA polymerase (Pol) active center can catalyze RNA cleavage. During gene transcription, the RNA polymerase (Pol) active center can catalyze RNA cleavage. The eukaryotic transcription factor TFIIS enhances elongation and nascent transcript cleavage activities of RNA polymerase II in a stalled elongation complex. Rpb9, a small subunit of RNA polymerase II, enhances the cleavage stimulation activity of S-II. These results suggest that both S-II and Rpb9 maintain transcriptional fidelity by stimulating the cleavage activity intrinsic to RNA polymerase II. It is also possible that the transcript cleavage activity of RNA polymerase II represents a proofreading function of the enzyme.. Nascent RNA cleavage by arrested RNA polymerase II does not require upstream translocation of the elongation complex on DNA. Intrinsic transcript cleavage in yeast RNA polymerase II elongation complexes.	yes

Post-natal erythromycin exposure and risk of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis. PURPOSE: Macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin, in particular, have been linked to the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS).  Overall, erythromycin exposure was significantly associated with development of IHPS [OR 2.45 (1.12-5.35), p = 0.02].  Data on erythromycin exposure in the first 14 days of life was extracted from 4/9 studies and identified a strong association between erythromycin exposure and subsequent development IHPS [OR 12.89 (7.67-2167), p < 0.00001].CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a significant association between post-natal erythromycin exposure and development of IHPS, which seems stronger when exposure occurs in the first 2 weeks of life. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Use of oral erythromycin in infants is associated with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS). CONCLUSIONS: Ingestion of oral azithromycin and erythromycin places young infants at increased risk of developing IHPS. An association between erythromycin and IHPS was also confirmed. Exposure to erythromycin in the first 14 days of life had an aOR of 13.3 (95% CI, 6.80-25.9), and 15 to 42 days of life, aOR 4.10 (95% CI, 1.69-9.91).  Early exposure to oral erythromycin in young infants, particularly in the first 2 weeks of life, has previously been associated with the development of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. We report a case of an infant who received an abbreviated 4-day course of oral erythromycin for suspected Chlamydia conjunctivitis at 5 days of life then underwent pyloromyotomy for pyloric stenosis less than 2 weeks later. Maternal and infant use of erythromycin and other macrolide antibiotics as risk factors for infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. A case report has suggested that exposure to erythromycin through breast milk might cause infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. Macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin, in particular, have been linked to the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS). Infants prescribed systemic erythromycin had increased risk of IHPS, with the highest risk in the first 2 weeks of age (relative risk = 10.51 for erythromycin in first 2 weeks, 95% CI 4.48, 24.66). There was an association between maternal prescriptions for nonerythromycin macrolides and infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (adjusted odds ratio 2.77, 95% confidence interval 1.22, 6.30, P =.01).<br><b>CONCLUSION</b>: The hypothesized association between erythromycin and infantile pyloric stenosis was not seen. Macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin, in particular, have been linked to the development of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS).	yes
