8	5158644cd24251bc0500008e	Does physical activity influence gut hormones?	Increases in blood PYY(3-36) levels were dependent on the exercise intensity (effect of session: P<0.001 by two-way ANOVA), whereas those in GLP-1 levels were similar between two different exercise sessions. A decrease in serum leptin levels (-48.4%, p < 0.001) was observed after intervention without changes in total peptide YY and insulin levels. ur data suggest that the control of spontaneous physical activity by gut hormones or their neuropeptide targets may represent an important mechanistic component of energy balance regulation Hunger and gut hormones remained unchanged during the bed rest. weight-bearing exercise has a greater exercise-induced appetite suppressive effect compared with non-weight-bearing exercise, and both forms of exercise lowered acylated ghrelin and increased total PYY, but the changes did not differ significantly between exercise modes. Appetite (P < 0.0005) and acylated ghrelin (P < 0.002) were suppressed during exercise but more so during SIE. Peptide YY increased during exercise but most consistently during END (P < 0.05). Acylated ghrelin was lowest in the afternoon of SIE (P = 0.018) despite elevated appetite Following the pre-exercise meal, ghrelin was suppressed ~17% and insulin and PYY were elevated ~157 and ~40%, respectively, relative to fasting (day 7). Following exercise, PYY, ghrelin, and GH were significantly (p < 0.0001) increased by ~11, ~16 and ~813%, respectively. The noted disruption in the typical inverse relationship between ghrelin and PYY following exercise suggests that interaction of these peptides may be at least partially responsible for post-exercise appetite suppression Plasma levels of PYY and GLP-1 were increased by exercise, whereas plasma ghrelin levels were unaffected by exercise These findings suggest ghrelin and PYY may regulate appetite during and after exercise, significant (P < 0.05) interaction effects for hunger, acylated ghrelin, and PYY, indicating suppressed hunger and acylated ghrelin during aerobic and resistance exercise and increased PYY during aerobic exercise 'exercise-induced anorexia' may potentially be linked to increased PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels. Hunger scores and PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels showed an inverse temporal pattern during the 1-h exercise/control intervention Exercise significantly increased mean PYY, GLP-1 and PP levels, and this effect was maintained during the post-exercise period for GLP-1 and PP. No significant effect of exercise was observed on postprandial levels of ghrelin following blood donation the strenuous exercise resulted in a marked reduction in the plasma leptin We conclude that strenuous physical exercise; 1) fails to affect plasma leptin level but when performed after meal but not after blood withdrawal it results in an increase and fall in plasma leptin, and 2) the release of gut hormones (gastrin, CCK and PP) and stress hormones (norepinephrine, cortisol, GH) increase immediately after exercise independently of feeding or blood donation the unrestricted exercise group has a significantly elevated SRIF-LI concentration Exercise has recently been reported to influence ghrelin and PYY concentrations.	yes
19	553f78c7ab98a37113000008	Are transcribed ultraconserved regions involved in cancer?	Although most cancer research has focused in mRNA, non-coding RNAs are also an essential player in tumorigenesis. In addition to the well-recognized microRNAs, recent studies have also shown that epigenetic silencing by CpG island hypermethylation of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) or small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), also occur in human neoplasia Starting from a genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the modulation of long noncoding transcripts from ultraconserved regions, termed transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). Interestingly, several hypoxia-upregulated T-UCRs, henceforth named 'hypoxia-induced noncoding ultraconserved transcripts' (HINCUTs), are also overexpressed in clinical samples from colon cancer patients Consistent with the hypothesis that T-UCRs have important function in tumor formation The importance of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) and transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) as altered elements in neoplasia, is also gaining recognition Expression levels of transcribed ultraconserved regions uc.73 and uc.388 are altered in colorectal cancer Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a subset of 481 sequences longer than 200 bp, which are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of human, rat and mouse genomes, and are actively transcribed. It has recently been proven in cancer systems that differentially expressed T-UCRs could alter the functional characteristics of malignant cells. Genome-wide profiling revealed that T-UCRs have distinct signatures in human leukemia and carcinoma  Our preliminary results suggest that uc.73 and uc.388 could be potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in CRC patients The transcribed-ultraconserved regions: a novel class of long noncoding RNAs involved in cancer susceptibility This review gives a picture of the state of the art of a novel class of long ncRNA known as transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). Most recent studies show that they are significantly altered in adult chronic lymphocytic leukemias, carcinomas, and pediatric neuroblastomas, leading to the hypothesis that UCRs may play a role in tumorigenesis and promising innovative future T-UCR-based therapeutic approaches CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of non-coding RNAs transcribed from ultraconserved regions in human cancer We focused on the transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), a subset of DNA sequences that are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of the human, rat and mouse genomes and that are located in both intra- and intergenic regions. We used a pharmacological and genomic approach to reveal the possible existence of an aberrant epigenetic silencing pattern of T-UCRs by treating cancer cells with a DNA-demethylating agent followed by hybridization to an expression microarray containing these sequences. We observed that DNA hypomethylation induces release of T-UCR silencing in cancer cells. Among the T-UCRs that were reactivated upon drug treatment, Uc.160+, Uc283+A and Uc.346+ were found to undergo specific CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing in cancer cells compared with normal tissues. The analysis of a large set of primary human tumors (n=283) demonstrated that hypermethylation of the described T-UCR CpG islands was a common event among the various tumor types. Our finding that, in addition to microRNAs, another class of ncRNAs (T-UCRs) undergoes DNA methylation-associated inactivation in transformed cells supports a model in which epigenetic and genetic alterations in coding and non-coding sequences cooperate in human tumorigenesis An integrative genomics screen uncovers ncRNA T-UCR functions in neuroblastoma tumours Different classes of non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs, have recently been implicated in the process of tumourigenesis. In this study, we examined the expression and putative functions of a novel class of non-coding RNAs known as transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) in neuroblastoma our results define a T-UCR expression landscape in neuroblastoma and suggest widespread T-UCR involvement in diverse cellular processes that are deregulated in the process of tumourigenesis Moreover, the recent demonstration that other ncRNAs, the ultraconserved genes (UCGs) or transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs), are involved in human cancerogenesis, suggests that the wider family of ncRNAs (including both miRNAs and UCGs) could contribute to the development of the malignant phenotype. Here we review the main studies investigating the role of miRNAs and UCRs in both normal hemopoiesis and hematological malignancies, and identify the molecular, clinical and therapeutic implications of these recent findings The transcribed-ultraconserved regions: a novel class of long noncoding RNAs involved in cancer susceptibility. Expression levels of transcribed ultraconserved regions uc.73 and uc.388 are altered in colorectal cancer. CpG island hypermethylation-associated silencing of non-coding RNAs transcribed from ultraconserved regions in human cancer. Starting from a genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the modulation of long noncoding transcripts from ultraconserved regions, termed transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs). The importance of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) and transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) as altered elements in neoplasia, is also gaining recognition.

31	530f7cdde3eabad021000001	Is amantadine effective for treatment of disorders conciousness?	We here provide a systematic overview of the therapeutic effects of amantadine, apomorphine and zolpidem in patients recovering from coma. Evidence from clinical trials using these commonly prescribed pharmacological agents suggests positive changes in the neurological status in patients, leading sometimes to dramatic improvements. Pharmaceuticals that act in the oxygen based amino acid systems of the brain include the GABAergic medications zolpidem and baclofen, while those that act in the monoamine axes include the dopaminergic medications L Dopa, amantadine, bromocriptine, apomorphine and methylphenidate, and the noradrenergic and serotonergic medications desipramine, amitriptyline, protriptyline and fluoxetine.  Sporadic cases of recovery from a DOC have been reported after the administration of various pharmacological agents (baclofen, zolpidem, amantadine etc.). Amantadine hydrochloride is one of the most commonly prescribed medications for patients with prolonged disorders of consciousness after traumatic brain injury. Preliminary studies have suggested that amantadine may promote functional recovery.  During the 4-week treatment period, recovery was significantly faster in the amantadine group than in the placebo group, as measured by the DRS score (difference in slope, 0.24 points per week; P=0.007), indicating a benefit with respect to the primary outcome measure.  Amantadine accelerated the pace of functional recovery during active treatment in patients with post-traumatic disorders of consciousness. Sporadic cases of dramatic recovery from DOC after the administration of various pharmacological agents, such as baclofen, zolpidem and amantadine, have been recently supported by intriguing scientific observations.  According to the 16 eligible studies, medical management by dopaminergic agents (levodopa, amantadine), zolpidem and median nerve stimulation, or surgical management by deep brain stimulation, extradural cortical stimulation, spinal cord stimulation and intrathecal baclofen have shown to improve the level of consciousness in certain cases.  Higher exposure of amantadine (average concentration of amantadine during 6 mg/kg/day > 1.5 mg/L) may be associated with better recovery of consciousness.  Based on the preliminary data, higher dosing may be considered in the setting of brain injury. Patients treated with PK-Merz exhibited the more significant restoration of consciousness and better dynamics (regress) of neurological deficit with the most intensive restoration of neurological deficit in the first day that allows to recommend the use of amantadine sulfate in the first hours of ischemic stroke and for the prevention of reperfusion damage in recanalisation therapy of ischemic stroke. There was no significant difference in the slopes of recovery during either arm for the Coma/Near-Coma Scale (P = 0.24) or the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (P = 0.28), although improvements in consciousness were noted by the physician during weeks when amantadine was given (P = 0.02).  This study suggests that amantadine facilitates recovery of consciousness in pediatric acquired brain injury and provides important information necessary to design future more definitive studies. The study has shown a positive effect of this drug at coma emergence, which manifested itself as clinical improvement and a better outcome of the disease. This article will review the evidence for the use of psychostimulants (methylphenidate), antidepressants (amitriptyline, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buproprion), Parkinson's medications (amantadine, bromocriptine, carbidopa/levodopa), anticonvulsants (valproic acid), modafinil (Provigil), lactate, hyperbaric oxygen chamber, electroconvulsive therapy, and transmagnetic stimulation, in patients following a head injury. Of the psychoactive medications, amantadine hydrochloride was associated with greater recovery and dantrolene sodium was associated with less recovery, in terms of the DRS score at 16 weeks but not the time until commands were followed.	yes
36	51598b08d24251bc0500009f	Does strenuous physical activity affect thyroid hormone metabolism?	The results of the present study in a unique experimental human model of maximal exposure to altitude and physical exercise demonstrate that extreme HA and strenuous physical exercise are coupled with specific endocrine adaptations. These include increased activity of the GH/IGF-I axis and a low T(3) syndrome 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 levels increase during strenuous exercise, and, at the end of the exercise bout, a decrease of T3 and T4 levels, with an increase in TSH during the following 4-5 days, is seen. the obtained results indicate that in intense exercise, causing the rapid development of fatigue, rapid increases in serum levels of hormones of the pituitary-adrenocortical, pituitary-gonadal and pituitary-thyroid systems occur. Mean levels of fasting plasma estradiol, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine and triiodothyronine were significantly lower in AR compared to ER and SE. Reductions in plasma T4, T3 and T3/T4 ratio are probably due to inhibition of T4 secretion and 5'-monodeiodination with possible conversion of T4 to reverse T3 (rT3). These processes may represent a mechanism for regulation of thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous and extended flight. Strenuous endurance training seems to have minor changes on the function of the thyroid gland. Depressed T4 levels in runners may rather be due to lowered TBG levels than due to direct effect of training. brief strenuous swimming or moderate bicycle exercise had minor or no effect on thyroid hormone concentrations when consideration was given to the attendant hemoconcentration. thyroxine were determined in 26 men participating in a 90-km cross-country ski race, before, immediately after, and on the following days Total thyroxine and free thyroxine in serum were significantly increased at the end of the race, but had returned to the pre-raced levels during the rest of the observation period. There are controversial results concerning thyroid hormone metabolism during strenuous exercise in adult athletes and only scant data concerning the impact of strenuous exercise on thyroid hormone metabolism in children and adolescents.	yes
37	56cf50253975bb303a00000b	Is the gene MAOA epigenetically modified by methylation?	Evidence that the methylation state of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene predicts brain activity of MAO A enzyme in healthy men. We found significant interindividual differences in methylation status and methylation patterns of the core MAOA promoter.  In the present study, DNA methylation patterns in the MAOA regulatory and exon 1/intron 1 region were investigated for association with panic disorder with particular attention to possible effects of gender and environmental factors.   The present pilot data suggest a potential role of MAOA gene hypomethylation in the pathogenesis of panic disorder particularly in female patients, possibly mediating a detrimental influence of negative life events.  The MAOA promoter was hypermethylated immediately upstream of the start codon in cholangiocarcinoma samples and cell lines but not in nonmalignant counterparts.  MAOA promoter methylation and susceptibility to carotid atherosclerosis: role of familial factors in a monozygotic twin sample. Because twins reared together share early life experience, which may leave a long-lasting epigenetic mark, aberrant MAOA methylation may represent an early biomarker for unhealthy familial environment. Effects of MAOA promoter methylation on susceptibility to paranoid schizophrenia. In conclusion, abnormalities of DNA methylation at the MAOA promoter may be associated with schizophrenia in males. In our study we analyzed DNA methylation patterns of 14 neuropsychiatric genes (COMT, DAT1, GABRA1, GNB3, GRIN2B, HTR1B, HTR2A, 5-HTT, MAOA, MAOB, NOS1, NR3C1, TPH1 and TH). D Our data suggest that aberrant epigenetic regulation of neuropsychiatric genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD. We conclude that smoking reliably decreases MAOA methylation, but exact characterization of effects on level of methylation depend on genotype, smoking history, current smoking status, gender, and region of the promoter-associated CpG Island examined. Given that DNA methylation is linked to the regulation of gene expression, we hypothesized that epigenetic mechanisms factor into the MAOA expression  the extended MAOA regulatory region contains two CpG islands (CGIs), one of which overlaps with the canonical MAOA promoter and the other is located further upstream; both CGIs exhibit sensitivity to differential methylation. Identification and characterization of putative methylation targets in the MAOA locus using bioinformatic approaches. DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism involved in the developmental regulation of gene expression.  MAOA methylation is associated with nicotine and alcohol dependence in women. In recent years, the role of epigenetic phenomenon, such as methylation, in mediating vulnerability to behavioral illness has become increasingly appreciated. One prominent locus at which epigenetic phenomena are thought to be in play is the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) locus.  We conclude that methylation of MAOA may play a significant role in common psychiatric illness and that further examination of epigenetic processes at this locus is in order. Analysis of CpG methylation in the MAOA promoter region revealed substantial methylation in females but not in males. Therefore, allelic mRNA expression is affected by genetic and epigenetic events, both with the potential to modulate biogenic amine tone in the CNS.	yes
44	532f08b8d6d3ac6a34000029	Are there any specific antidotes for rivaroxaban?	"Novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs)--apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban--have a significantly smaller risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, two facts make this situation complicated: First, the risk of hematoma expansion is unknown for NOACs. Second, there is no specific antidote for neither of the NOACs. he new oral anticoagulants dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and apixaban (Eliquis) have predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles and are alternatives to warfarin. However, many physicians are wary of these drugs, since there is limited evidence on how to manage bleeding in patients taking them, and since no specific antidote is known to reverse their anticoagulant effect.  Given the absence of a specific antidote, the action to be taken in these situations must be defined.  The fact that there is no specific antidote to reverse the anticoagulant action of the new anticoagulants can impair management of hemorrhagic complications;  Like any new therapy, the potential benefits must be weighed against the potential challenges and one of the most concerning aspects of the new target-specific oral anticoagulants is the lack of a proven method to reverse their effect. Unlike the vitamin K antagonist, i.e. warfarin, there is no specific antidote for these medications.  Two major drawbacks are on the one hand the risk of drug accumulation in kidney and/or liver disease and, on the other hand, the lack of specific antidotes. NOA also have other unresolved problems: drug interactions are still possible, specific coagulation test to assess them must be developed, and no specific antidote is currently available in case of hemorrhagic complication. But they have disadvantages also, they depend on renal clearance, they can interact with other medicaments and they lack a specific antidote.  While these trial data are extremely encouraging, several practical issues (e.g., lack of specific antidote, safety of long-term treatment or cost-effectiveness in ""real-life"" clinical practice) still need to be elucidated. In case of massive bleeding, management is unclear and none of these newer agents has a specific antidote that completely reverses its anticoagulant effect. The short half-life of these new agents compensates for the lack of any specific antidote in many instances.  Currently, none of these new agents has a specific antidote, and little advise can be given on how to manage a major bleeding event. Rivaroxaban, which inhibits activated factor X (Xa), is currently in clinical trials and is the most advanced factor Xa inhibitor. The drug offers once-daily oral dosing, with no need for injections, dose titration, or frequent blood tests to monitor the international normalised ratio. It has a rapid onset of action and, although there is no specific antidote, it has a short plasma elimination half-life (about 5-9 hours).  Increased use of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban as oral anticoagulants for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and acute deep venous thrombosis has increased despite the lack of known antidotes to these medications. There is no antidote for reversal and no reliable laboratory monitoring of the anticoagulant effect for emergency situations.  Further concerns about the use of NOAC in the elderly are the high prevalence of renal insufficiency in AF patients >75 years of age, the largely unknown risk of drug-drug and drug-food interactions, the lack of easily available laboratory monitoring tests of anticoagulant activity and the lack of an antidote. Specific antidotes for the reversal of the anticoagulant effect of these drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies against the direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran or recombinant Xa-analog in the case of factor Xa inhibitors, are still being investigated in early clinical trials. In early 2013 there is no antidote for dabigatran, rivaroxaban or apixaban, nor any specific treatment with proven efficacy for severe bleeding linked to these drugs. "	no
46	56c0708eef6e39474100001f	Is the abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements disfavored in cancer cells?	Abnormal dosage of ultraconserved elements is highly disfavored in healthy cells but not cancer cells. We begin by showing that depletion for UCEs characterizes the most recent large-scale human CNV datasets and then find that even newly formed de novo CNVs, which have passed through meiosis at most once, are significantly depleted for UCEs. In striking contrast, CNVs arising specifically in cancer cells are, as a rule, not depleted for UCEs and can even become significantly enriched. This observation raises the possibility that CNVs that arise somatically and are relatively newly formed are less likely to have established a CNV profile that is depleted for UCEs. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state. In support of this latter explanation, somatic CNVs that are not associated with disease are depleted for UCEs. Finally, we show that it is possible to observe the CNVs of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells become depleted of UCEs over time, suggesting that depletion may be established through selection against UCE-disrupting CNVs without the requirement for meiotic divisions. Alternatively, lack of depletion for UCEs from cancer CNVs may reflect the diseased state.	no

55	511a16f9df1ebcce7d000005	Are there any DNMT3 proteins present in plants?	De novo DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana is catalyzed by the methyltransferase DRM2, a homolog of the mammalian de novo methyltransferase DNMT3. Here we describe DNA methyltransferase genes from both Arabidopsis and maize that show a high level of sequence similarity to Dnmt3, suggesting that they encode plant de novo methyltransferases. Relative to all known eukaryotic methyltransferases, these plant proteins contain a novel arrangement of the motifs required for DNA methyltransferase catalytic activity. The N termini of these methyltransferases contain a series of ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains.  BLASTX searches and phylogenetic analysis suggested that five cDNAs belonged to four classes (Dnmt1, Dnmt2, CMT and Dnmt3) of DNA methyltransferase genes.	yes

79	5167be1a298dcd4e5100005c	is intense physical activity associated with longevity ?	We found a very significant increase in average longevity (17%) of the cyclists when compared with the general population. The age at which 50% of the general population died was 73.5 vs. 81.5 years in Tour de France participants. Our major finding is that repeated very intense exercise prolongs life span in well trained practitioners. Competitive exercise does not induce cardiac damage in individuals with healthy hearts, but does induce physiological functional and structural cardiac adaptations which have positive effects on life expectancy. Medallists lived an average of 2.8 years longer than controls. Medallists in eight of the nine country groups had a significant survival advantage compared with controls. Gold, silver, and bronze medallists each enjoyed similar sized survival advantages. Medallists in endurance sports and mixed sports had a larger survival advantage over controls at 30 years (1.13, 1.09 to 1.17; 1.11, 1.09 to 1.13) than that of medallists in power sports (1.05, 1.01 to 1.08). CONCLUSIONS: Olympic medallists live longer than the general population, irrespective of country, medal, or sport. This study was not designed to explain this effect, but possible explanations include genetic factors, physical activity, healthy lifestyle, and the wealth and status that come with international sporting glory. Long-term endurance training induces in elderly subjects an increased HRV and a higher exercise working capacity, which are well-established predictors of cardiovascular and overall mortality. Sports activity in adolescents and young adults was associated with an increased risk of SD, both in males and females. Sports, per se, was not a cause of the enhanced mortality, but it triggered SD in those athletes who were affected by cardiovascular conditions predisposing to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias during physical exercise.	yes
82	54f5f8925f206a0c06000003	Has the protein SETMAR (Metnase) a transposase domain?	Metnase (SETMAR) is a SET-transposase fusion protein that promotes nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair in humans. The transposase domain protein Metnase/SETMAR suppresses chromosomal translocations.  Metnase (also termed SETMAR) is a fusion of a histone methylase and transposase protein that arose specifically in primates.  the only intact Hsmar1 transposase gene exists within a chimeric SET-transposase fusion protein referred to as Metnase or SETMAR.  The Metnase transposase has been remarkably conserved through evolution; Metnase (also known as SETMAR) is a SET and transposase fusion protein in humans and plays a positive role in double-strand break (DSB) repair. While the SET domain possesses histone lysine methyltransferase activity, the transposase domain is responsible for 5'-terminal inverted repeat (TIR)-specific binding, DNA looping, and DNA cleavage activities.  Metnase is a fusion gene comprising a SET histone methyl transferase domain and a transposase domain derived from the Mariner transposase. ulated by the DNA repair component Metnase (also termed SETMAR). Metnase contains a SET histone methylase and transposase nuclease domain Metnase is a human SET and transposase domain protein  The human set and transposase domain protein Metnase  of transposase-related sequences in humans are pseudogenes. We recently isolated and characterized a SET and transposase domain protein termed Metnase that promotes DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Both the SET and transposase domain were required for its NHEJ activity. Metnase, also known as SETMAR, is a SET and transposase fusion protein with an undefined role in mammalian DNA repair. Biochemical characterization of a SET and transposase fusion protein, Metnase: i Metnase (SETMAR) is a SET and transposase fusion protein that promotes in vivo end joining activity and mediates genomic integration of foreign DNA.

Vortioxetine is an orally administered small molecule developed by Lundbeck A/S for the once-daily treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Vortioxetine received its first global approval for MDD in the USA in September 2013 and regulatory approval for its use in this indication in the EU (where it has received a positive opinion) and Canada is awaited.  This article summarizes the milestones in the development of vortioxetine leading to this first approval for MDD. Vortioxetine was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder. On the primary efficacy endpoint, both vortioxetine doses were statistically significantly superior to placebo, with a mean difference to placebo (n=158) of -5.5 (vortioxetine 15 mg, P<0.0001, n=149) and -7.1 MADRS points (vortioxetine 20 mg, P<0.0001, n=151). The change in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms was maintained throughout the study as reflected by a 24-item Hamilton Depression Scale total score of 8.2 at week 52 (from 17.6 at open-label baseline) in the observed case data set. Vortioxetine is a multi-modal antidepressant that functions as a human 5-HT3A and 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and inhibitor of the serotonin transporter.  Approval for the treatment of MDD was based on a clinical development programme that included six positive 6-8 week studies, including one study in elderly people, and one positive maintenance study in adults. Vortioxetine represents another option for the treatment of MDD.  The multimodal compounds vortioxetine and vilazodone are examples of this approach with diverse mechanisms, and their different clinical effects will provide valuable insights into serotonergic modulation of glutamate transmission for the potential treatment of depression and associated cognitive dysfunction. Two new antidepressant drugs, vilazodone (marketed in the USA) and vortioxetine (in development) incorporate partial 5-HT1A-R agonist properties with SERT blockade. Novel drugs in development include those that combine multiple simultaneous pharmacologic mechanisms in addition to SERT inhibition within the same molecule, such as vilazodone (combining 5HT1A partial agonism with SERT inhibition), triple reuptake inhibitors (combining norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibition with SERT inhibition), and vortioxetine, a multimodal antidepressant combining actions at the G protein receptor mode (5HT1A and 5HT1B partial agonism and 5HT7 antagonism), at the ion channel mode (5HT3 antagonism) as well as the neurotransmitter transporter mode (SERT inhibition).  In this study of adults with MDD treated for 8 weeks with vortioxetine 2.5 mg or 5 mg per day, reductions in depression symptoms were not statistically significant compared with placebo.  However, on the basis of these findings, vortioxetine (2.5, 5, 10 mg/day) demonstrated a favourable safety and tolerability profile and maintained effectiveness over 12 months of treatment.  In this study of adults with MDD, 5 mg vortioxetine did not differ significantly from placebo in reducing depression symptoms after 6 wk of treatment. After 8 weeks of treatment with Lu AA21004 10 mg, there was a significant reduction in HDRS-24 total score compared with placebo in adults with MDD. In conclusion, Lu AA21004 was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of elderly patients with recurrent major depressive disorder. Thus, Lu AA21004 was effective in preventing relapse of MDD and was well tolerated as maintenance treatment.  Findings on secondary outcome measures, using MMRM instead of LOCF, were supportive of likely efficacy for Lu AA21004 5mg and 10mg and duloxetine.  In this study, treatment with 5 mg and 10 mg Lu AA21004 for 6 wk was efficacious and well tolerated in patients with MDD. Results from phase II clinical trials have reported improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms after 6 weeks of treatment. 	yes

98	55032bbfe9bde69634000032	Is there an association between TERT promoter mutation and survival of glioblastoma patients?	Glioblastoma patients with TERT mutations showed a shorter survival than those without TERT mutations in univariate analysis (median, 9.3 vs. 10.5 months; P = 0.015) and multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and gender (HR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.01-1.88, P = 0.041). However, TERT mutations had no significant impact on patients' survival in multivariate analysis after further adjusting for other genetic alterations, or when primary and secondary glioblastomas were separately analysed. These results suggest that the prognostic value of TERT mutations for poor survival is largely due to their inverse correlation with IDH1 mutations, which are a significant prognostic marker of better survival in patients with secondary glioblastomas. Patients with tumors lacking hTERT expression/TA showed a significant survival benefit (Kaplan-Meier test, both P < .01), which, however, was based exclusively on the younger patient subgroup (≤60 y, both P < .005; >60 y, both ns).  Glioblastoma patients with TERT mutations showed a shorter survival than those without TERT mutations in univariate analysis (median, 9.3 vs	yes
133	5544bcde5beec11c10000003	Are there conserved noncoding elements identified between genomes of human and teleosts?	"We report evidence for a mechanism for the maintenance of long-range conserved synteny across vertebrate genomes. We found the largest mammal-teleost conserved chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), their developmental regulatory target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally unrelated ""bystander"" genes After whole genome duplication in teleosts, GRBs, including HCNEs and target genes, were often maintained in both copies, while bystander genes were typically lost from one GRB, strongly suggesting that evolutionary pressure acts to keep the single-copy GRBs of higher vertebrates intact. We show that loss of bystander genes and other mutational events suffered by duplicated GRBs in teleost genomes permits target gene identification and HCNE/target gene assignment Vertebrate genomes contain thousands of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) that often function as tissue-specific enhancers. In this study, we have identified CNEs in human, dog, chicken, Xenopus, and four teleost fishes (zebrafish, stickleback, medaka, and fugu) using elephant shark, a cartilaginous vertebrate, as the base genome and investigated the evolution of these ancient vertebrate CNEs (aCNEs) in bony vertebrate lineages This implicates the ""fish-specific"" whole-genome duplication in the accelerated evolution and the loss of a large number of both copies of duplicated CNEs in teleost fishes We found zebrafish conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) with pan-vertebrate as well as fish-specific orthologous sequences from across 200 kb of the zebrafish fgf8a genomic regulatory block to direct reporter expression in patterns consistent with the expression pattern of fgf8a  A significant number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) shared between cartilaginous fishes and tetrapods have diverged beyond recognition in teleost fishes. The divergence of CNEs seems to have been initiated in basal ray-finned fishes before the WGD. The fast evolving singleton and duplicated genes as well as the divergent CNEs might have contributed to the diversity of teleost fishes We found the largest mammal-teleost conserved chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs), their developmental regulatory target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally unrelated ""bystander"" genes. Ancient vertebrate conserved noncoding elements have been evolving rapidly in teleost fishes. A significant number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) shared between cartilaginous fishes and tetrapods have diverged beyond recognition in teleost fishes. We have used a transposon-based transgenic assay in zebrafish to evaluate noncoding sequences at the zebrafish ret locus, conserved among teleosts, and at the human RET locus, conserved among mammals. Using computational analysis and exploiting the diversity of teleost genomes, we identified a cluster of highly conserved noncoding sequences surrounding the Six3 gene"	yes
143	5311ceeae3eabad021000008	Is there any software for automated analysis of immuno-histochemistry images?	The LIM homeobox gene Lhx2 is expressed in cortical progenitors during development and also in the superficial layers of the neocortex in maturity. However, analysis of Lhx2 function at later stages of cortical development has been hampered by severe phenotypes associated with early loss of function.  The vein graft samples were obtained on each time point after surgery. The expression of the EDRz transfected in the vein graft was detected using a fluorescent microscope. Early growth response gene-1 (Egr-1) mRNA was measured using reverse transcription-PCR and in situ hybridization. And the protein expression of Egr-1 was detected by using western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. Tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) is a multifunctional enzyme, which amongst other functions, is involved in cell differentiation. Therefore, we hypothesized that TG2 contributes to differentiation of OPCs into OLGs and thereby stimulates remyelination. 	yes
149	55152c2946478f2f2c000005	Is the gene DUX4 epigenetically regulated in somatic cells?	There are several genes on chromosome 4q35 region including DUX4 within D4Z4 repeats. Transcription of these genes is usually repressed by epigenetic modifications of this chromosomal region and also accumulation of transcriptional repressors to the repeat array. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues.  The human double-homeodomain retrogene DUX4 is expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues. Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX4, a retrogene encoding a germline transcription factor encoded in each repeat.  These mice recapitulate important epigenetic and DUX4 expression attributes seen in patients and controls, respectively, including high DUX4 expression levels in the germline, (incomplete) epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, and FSHD-specific variegated DUX4 expression in sporadic muscle nuclei associated with D4Z4 chromatin relaxation. DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally epigenetically silenced in somatic cells. In contrast to control skeletal muscle and most other somatic tissues, full-length DUX4 transcript and protein is expressed at relatively abundant levels in human testis, most likely in the germ-line cells. Induced pluripotent (iPS) cells also express full-length DUX4 and differentiation of control iPS cells to embryoid bodies suppresses expression of full-length DUX4, whereas expression of full-length DUX4 persists in differentiated FSHD iPS cells. Together, these findings indicate that full-length DUX4 is normally expressed at specific developmental stages and is suppressed in most somatic tissues. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues. DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally epigenetically silenced in somatic cells.  DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally epigenetically silenced in somatic cells. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues. Normally expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues, DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle induces expression of many germline, stem cell, and other genes that might account for the pathophysiology of FSHD. Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues The human double-homeodomain retrogene DUX4 is expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues Normally expressed in the testis and epigenetically repressed in somatic tissues, DUX4 expression in skeletal muscle induces expression of many germline, stem cell, and other genes that might account for the pathophysiology of FSHD DUX4, a retrogene contained in the D4Z4 repeats, is normally epigenetically silenced in somatic cells Recent studies provide compelling evidence that a retrotransposed gene in the D4Z4 repeat, DUX4, is expressed in the human germline and then epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues The identification of the gene(s) and the exact epigenetic pathway underlining this disease will be mandatory to increase the rate of diagnosis for FSHD2 patients and to confirm the hypothesis of a common FSHD1 and FSHD2 pathophysiological pathway involving DUX4 gene This deletion induces epigenetic modifications that affect the expression of several genes located in the vicinity. In each D4Z4 element, we identified the double homeobox 4 (DUX4) gene. DUX4 expresses a transcription factor that plays a major role in the development of FSHD through the initiation of a large gene dysregulation cascade that causes myogenic differentiation defects, atrophy and reduced response to oxidative stress.  decreased epigenetic repression and variegated expression of DUX4 in skeletal muscle (incomplete) epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is characterized by chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite array on chromosome 4 and expression of the D4Z4-encoded DUX4 gene in skeletal muscle. derepression of the DUX4 retrogene The aim of our study was to identify relationships between epigenetic parameters correlating with a relaxed chromatin state of the DUX4 promoter region and clinical severity as measured by a clinical severity score or muscle pathologic changes in D4Z4 contraction-dependent (FSHD1) and -independent (FSHD2) facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy patients.  Specifically, abundance of RNA transcripts encoded by the DUX4 locus correlated to differential DNA methylation and H3K36me3 enrichment. Together, these findings indicate that full-length DUX4 is normally expressed at specific developmental stages and is suppressed in most somatic tissue	yes

154	54da0c524b1fd0d33c00000b	Is phospholamban phosphorylated by Protein kinase A?	cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation of PLB phosphorylation of PLN, at either Ser(16) by PKA  Activation of cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA2a) by beta1-agonists involves cAMP- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB), which relieves the inhibitory effects of PLB on SERCA2a.  Phospholamban (PLB) is a sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) protein that when phosphorylated at Ser16 by PKA phosphorylation of PLB by the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA).  cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-mediated phospholamban (PLB) phosphorylation at serine-16 Phospholamban (PLB) is a major target of the beta-adrenergic cascade in the heart, functioning to modulate contractile force by altering the rate of calcium re-sequestration by the Ca-ATPase. Functionally, inhibition by PLB binding is manifested by shifts in the calcium dependence of Ca-ATPase activation toward higher calcium levels; phosphorylation of PLB by PKA reverses the inhibitory action of PLB. phosphorylation of both PLB residues (Ser16, PKA site, and Thr17, CaMKII site)  Phosphorylation of Ser(16) by PKA stabilization of the structure of PLB following phosphorylation of Ser(16) Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase, and this inhibition is relieved by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation.  Two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps of phosphorylated phospholamban indicated that cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates at a single site, A, and Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphorylates at sites C1 and C2 in the low molecular weight form, where A is different from C1 but may be the same as C2. Because SR function is regulated by phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLB), a SR protein phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) at Ser(16)and Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) at Thr(17), the phosphorylation of these residues during ischemia and reperfusion was examined in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts These changes were associated with reduced protein expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) and protein kinase A phosphorylated phospholamban (PLB), which was reduced in HF, but essentially abolished in VD-HF The data indicate that 1) phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser16 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase is the main regulator of beta-adrenergic-induced cardiac relaxation definitely preceding Thr17 phosphorylation and 2) the beta-adrenergic-mediated phosphorylation of Thr17 by Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase required influx of Ca2+ through the L-type Ca2+ channel Here we extend this model to explain the reversal of SERCA2a inhibition that occurs after phosphorylation of PLB at Ser(16) by protein kinase A (PKA) and after binding of the anti-PLB monoclonal antibody 2D12, which recognizes residues 7-13 of PLB Phospholamban is phosphorylated in heart by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, cGMP-dependent protein kinase and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CM-kinase-II) and in smooth muscle cells by cGMP-dependent protein kinase Phospholamban, the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum proteolipid, is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase, by Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, and by an endogenous Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, the identity of which remains to be defined	yes
162	52cae04c03868f1b06000024	Does molindone affect body weight?	Mean weight increased by 0.54 kg, and mean body mass index by 0.24 kg/m(2).  A large-scale trial comparing a first-generation antipsychotic (molindone) with newer agents did not find significant differences in treatment response, although the newer antipsychotics were associated with more severe weight gain.  No agent demonstrated superior efficacy, and all were associated with side effects, including weight gain.  The three treatment arms did not significantly differ in symptom decrease or time to discontinuation. Akathisia was more common with molindone and elevated prolactin concentrations more common with risperidone. Although weight gain and metabolic adverse events had occurred more often with olanzapine and risperidone during the acute trial, no significant between-drug differences emerged in most of these parameters during maintenance treatment.  Olanzapine and risperidone were associated with significantly greater weight gain. Olanzapine showed the greatest risk of weight gain and significant increases in fasting cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, insulin, and liver transaminase levels. Molindone led to more self-reports of akathisia.  Molindone is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but it does cause significantly more weight loss (2RCTs n=60 RR 2.78, CI 1.10 to 6.99, NNH 5 CI 2 to 77).  Molindone may be an effective antipsychotic but its adverse effect profile does not differ significantly from that of typical antipsychotics (apart from the event of weight loss).  Convergent evidence suggests a hierarchy in the magnitude of BWG that may be induced by diverse agents, being very high for clozapine and olanzapine; high for quetiapine, zotepin, chlorpromazine, and thioridazine; moderate for risperidone and sertindole; and low for ziprazidone, amisulpiride, haloperidol, fluphenazine, pimozide, and molindone.  Loxapine and molindone induce weight decreases, and these exceptions are difficult to explain. It is no more or less likely than typical drugs to cause movement disorders, but causes significantly more weight loss (RR 2.78, CI 1.10 to 6.99). Molindone may be an effective antipsychotic; however, its adverse effect profile does not differ significantly from that of typical antipsychotics, apart from the event of weight loss.  Among conventional agents, mean weight change ranged from a reduction of 0.39 kg with molindone to an increase of 3.19 kg with thioridazine. Weight gain has been reported with nearly every antipsychotic drug on the market (molindone is an exception).  Although almost all antipsychotics induce bodyweight gain, molindone and loxapine appear to induce bodyweight loss.  Clozapine and low-potency phenothiazines are associated with the largest gains and molindone with weight loss, but the mechanism is not known.  On average, molindone patients lost 5 pounds over the 6 weeks of treatment, whereas thioridazine patients gained 6 pounds.  Clinically, molindone has a tendency to cause weight loss and may have less effect on seizure threshold than conventional antipsychotic agents  Monthly weights and neuroleptic dosages during the first three months of psychiatric hospitalization were compared between matched groups of patients receiving molindone, a combination of molindone and other neuroleptics, or other neuroleptic drugs. We found no significant differences in weight gain among the three groups.  The weight-reducing property of molindone, a recently introduced antipsychotic drug, was tested in 9 hospitalized chronic schizophrenic patients. There was an average weight loss of 7.6 kg after 3 months on molindone; most of the loss occurred during the first month.	yes
173	533d0f44c45e13371400000e	Is signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) critical for tumor angiogenesis progression?	 (STAT3) is critical for cancer progression by regulating tumor cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Herein, we investigated the regulation of STAT3 activation and the therapeutic effects of Icaritin, a prenyl flavonoid derivative from Epimedium Genus, in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).   Overall, these results suggest that Icaritin strongly inhibits STAT3 activation and is a potentially effective therapeutic option for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma we have reviewed important signaling pathways that are closely related to radiosensitization, such as cell cycle arrest, tumor angiogenesis, JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway and Mismatch repair Interleukin-27 signaling is mediated by the JAK-STAT pathway via activation of STAT1 and STAT3, which have tumor suppressive and oncogenic activities, respectively. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis are key processes in carcinogenesis. The inhibition of STAT3 activation had no effect on the development of the epithelial phenotype. STAT3 plays a vital role in inducing and maintaining a pro-carcinogenic inflammatory microenvironment and is reported to be a critical mediator of the oncogenic effects of EGFR mutations. STAT3 activation is mediated through JAK family kinases  EESB treatment could significantly suppress the activation of several CRC-related pathways, including STAT3, Erk, and p38 signalings in tumor tissues, and alter the expression of multiple critical target genes such as Bcl-2, Bax, Cyclin D1, CDK4, and p21. These molecular effects lead to the induction of cancer cell apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. Our findings demonstrate that SB possesses a broad range of antitumor activities because of its ability to affect multiple intracellular targets Western immunoblotting analyses of mouse lung tissues indicated significantly lower level of pSTAT3 and Mcl-1 in the carcinogen plus DMAPT group relative to the group treated with the carcinogen only. Given the evidence that STAT3 is activated in more than half of lung cancers and it regulates genes involved in cell proliferation, survival and angiogenesis, DMAPT is a promising agent for lung cancer chemoprevention in subjects who are at high risk of developing this devastating disease. (STAT3) is a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, originally discovered as a transducer of signal from cell surface receptors to the nucleus. It is activated by tyrosine phosphorylation at position 705 leading to its dimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and activation of gene transcription. Under normal physiological conditions, STAT3 activation is tightly regulated. However, compelling evidence suggests that STAT3 is constitutively activated in many cancers and plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and metastasis. It regulates cellular proliferation, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis that are critical for cancer metastasis STAT3) signaling pathway plays important roles in oncogenesis, angiogenesis, immunity, and tumor cell invasion. In the present study, we investigated the association of interleukin   Phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) regulates many genes that are necessarily expressed in cancer initiation, development, and progression, being involved in proliferation, anti-apoptosis, invasion, angiogenesis, and immune surveillance evasion	yes

180	52b2ec944003448f55000002	Can FOXOs modulate longevity?	Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors have a conserved function in regulating metazoan lifespan. In contrast to FoxO1, FoxO3a and FoxO6 were specifically diminished in the CNS of HFD animals possibly contributing to the reduced lifespan observed in these animals. Interestingly, many target proteins of AMPK are so-called longevity factors, e.g., SIRT1, p53, and FoxOs, which not only can increase the stress resistance and extend the lifespan of many organisms but also inhibit the inflammatory responses.  Components of anti-ageing and autophagy include SirTs and FoxOs. Since Sirts and FoxOs are reliable markers of longevity, the results appear to suggest that Longevinex induces longevity after prolonged feeding via induction of autophagy, while it converts death signals into survival signals and provides cardioprotection within a relatively shorter period of time. Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors are involved in various cellular processes, including cell proliferation, stress resistance, metabolism, and longevity In this respect, members of the mammalian forkhead transcription factors of the O class (FoxOs) that include FoxO1, FoxO3, FoxO4 and FoxO6 are increasingly being recognized as exciting prospects for multiple disorders. These transcription factors govern development, proliferation, survival and longevity during multiple cellular environments that can involve oxidative stress.  Here we discuss the fascinating but complex role of FoxOs during cellular injury and oxidative stress, progenitor cell development, fertility, angiogenesis, cardiovascular function, cellular metabolism and diabetes, cell longevity, immune surveillance and cancer. Many longevity genes, e.g. FoxOs and SIRT1, are inhibitors of NF-kappaB signaling.  Interestingly, several longevity genes such as SIRT1, SIRT6, and FoxOs can clearly suppress NF-kappaB signaling and in this way delay the aging process and extend lifespan. Yet, FoxOs also can significantly affect normal cell survival and longevity, requiring new treatments for neoplastic growth to modulate novel pathways that integrate cell proliferation, metabolism, inflammation and survival. These observations link FoxO function in mammalian systems with the evolutionarily conserved role of FoxO in promotion of stress resistance and longevity in lower phylogenetic systems. Furthermore, these findings have implications for aging in higher organisms and in malignant stem cell biology, and suggest that FoxOs may play an important role in the maintenance and integrity of stem cell compartments in a broad spectrum of tissues. Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors are important downstream targets of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway and crucial regulators of cell fate. This function of FoxOs relies on their ability to control diverse cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, DNA repair, defense against oxidative stress and ageing. This brief review focuses on the molecular mechanisms, cellular effects and resulting organismal phenotypes generated by differentially regulated FoxO proteins and discusses our current understanding of the role of FoxOs in disease and ageing processes. In this review, we focus on the several interactions of aging-associated signaling cascades regulated either by Sirtuins and FoxOs or NF-kappaB signaling pathways. We provide evidence that signaling via the longevity factors of FoxOs and SIRT1 can inhibit NF-kappaB signaling and simultaneously protect against inflamm-aging process. In diverse species transcription factors belonging to the forkhead/winged helix box gene, group O (FOXO) subfamily have been found to be crucial in downstream suppression of the life-shortening effects of insulin/insulin-like growth factor-I receptor signalling pathways that, when upregulated, accelerate ageing by suppression of FOXO.  In humans, FOXO3a, as well as FOXO1 and -4, and their downstream effectors, could hold the key to counteracting ageing and common diseases. FOXO transcription factors have important roles in metabolism, cellular proliferation, stress tolerance, and aging. 	yes

201	56bb6b0eac7ad1001900000e	Is flibanserin effetive for Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder? 	Mechanism of action of flibanserin, a multifunctional serotonin agonist and antagonist (MSAA), in hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Flibanserin is a novel multifunctional serotonin agonist and antagonist (MSAA) that improves sexual functioning in premenopausal women who suffer from reduced sexual interest and desire. Flibanserin is a novel, non-hormonal drug for the treatment of HSDD in pre- and postmenopausal women, although the application submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by Sprout Pharmaceuticals is only for premenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: In naturally postmenopausal women with HSDD, flibanserin, compared with placebo, has been associated with improvement in sexual desire, improvement in the number of SSEs, and reduced distress associated with low sexual desire, and is well tolerated. INTRODUCTION: Flibanserin is a mixed 5-HT1A agonist/5-HT2A antagonist that has been developed for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder in women BACKGROUND: Flibanserin, a novel serotonin (5-HT)(1A) agonist and 5-HT(2A) antagonist, has been shown to increase sexual desire and reduce distress in women with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD).  Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is the most commonly described form of female sexual dysfunction. There is currently no pharmacological therapy approved to treat HSDD, and therefore, there is an unmet medical need for the development of efficacious treatment alternatives. Flibanserin is a novel, non-hormonal drug for the treatment of HSDD in pre- and postmenopausal women, although the application submitted to the U.S.  Sexual function adverse events across flibanserin groups were generally comparable to placebo.Although these studies were not designed or powered to compare sexual function outcomes, results suggested a potential benefit of flibanserin on sexual function, particularly on female sexual desire, and provided a rationale to evaluate the efficacy of flibanserin as a treatment for female hypoactive sexual desire disorder.	yes

Inherited mutations in the gene coding for the intermediate filament protein desmin have been demonstrated to cause severe skeletal and cardiac myopathies. Mutations in the intermediate filament (IF) protein desmin cause severe forms of myofibrillar myopathy characterized by partial aggregation of the extrasarcomeric desmin cytoskeleton and structural disorganization of myofibrils. The family of 70 intermediate filament genes (including those encoding keratins, desmins, and lamins) is now known to be associated with a wide range of diverse diseases, at least 72 distinct human pathologies, including skin blistering, muscular dystrophy, cardiomyopathy, premature aging syndromes, neurodegenerative disorders, and cataract.  Mutations in desmin have been associated with a subset of human myopathies. Characterization of a zebrafish (Danio rerio) desmin cDNA: an early molecular marker of myogenesis. Acute effects of desmin mutations on cytoskeletal and cellular integrity in cardiac myocytes. Desmin is a muscle-specific protein and a constitutive subunit of the intermediate filaments (IF) in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles. It is an early marker of skeletal muscle myogenesis. We have characterized a clone of desmin cDNA from an embryonic zebrafish (Danio rerio) cDNA library.  Immunohistochemical investigation showed a positive reaction for smooth muscle actin and desmins in the spindle cells proliferated in the lymph nodes; no cytokeratin positivity was detected.  We have raised monoclonal antibodies (Mab) to the Mr 55,000 desmin polypeptide, electrophoretically purified from cytoskeletal preparations of isolated bovine heart Purkinje fibers.  Mesothelial and ovarian carcinoma cells could not be distinguished by (intermediate) filament typing, using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to keratins, vimentins and desmins.

250	56a375f8496b62f23f000002	Are CTCF and BORIS involved in genome regulation and cancer?	"CTCF is ubiquitously expressed and plays diverse roles in gene regulation, imprinting, insulation, intra/interchromosomal interactions, nuclear compartmentalisation, and alternative splicing. CTCF has a single paralogue, the testes-specific CTCF-like gene (CTCFL)/BORIS. CTCF and BORIS can be deregulated in cancer. The tumour suppressor gene CTCF can be mutated or deleted in cancer, or CTCF DNA binding can be altered by epigenetic changes. BORIS is aberrantly expressed frequently in cancer, leading some to propose a pro-tumourigenic role for BORIS. However, BORIS can inhibit cell proliferation, and is mutated in cancer similarly to CTCF suggesting BORIS activation in cancer may be due to global genetic or epigenetic changes typical of malignant transformation  The investigation of the molecular mechanisms engaged by CTCF to modulate tumor-related genes emphasizes the cell-type dependency of its tumor suppressor role. Indeed, the ability of CTCF to bind their promoters strictly depends by cell-type features as DNA methylation, BORIS-binding and post-translational modifications as PARYlation Moreover, reduction of CTCF in normally BORIS-negative human fibroblasts resulted in derepression of BORIS promoters. These results provide a mechanistic basis for understanding cancer-related associations between haploinsufficiency of CTCF and BORIS derepression, and between the lack of functional p53 and aberrant activation of BORIS CTCF and BORIS in genome regulation and cancer. The novel BORIS + CTCF gene family is uniquely involved in the epigenetics of normal biology and cancer. Collectively, these data indicate that reciprocal binding of CTCF and BORIS to the NY-ESO-1 promoter mediates epigenetic regulation of this CT gene in lung cancer cells, and suggest that induction of BORIS may be a novel strategy to augment immunogenicity of pulmonary carcinomas. BORIS is the only known paralog of CTCF, a gene intimately involved in genomic imprinting, chromatin insulation, and nuclear regulation. However, BORIS can inhibit cell proliferation, and is mutated in cancer similarly to CTCF suggesting BORIS activation in cancer may be due to global genetic or epigenetic changes typical of malignant transformation. We suggest that BORIS is likely tethering epigenetic machinery to a novel class of CTCF/BORIS 11ZF target sequences that mediate induction of cancer-testis genes. Unlike CTCF, BORIS expression has been reported only in the testis and certain malignancies, leading to its classification as a ""cancer-testis"" antigen."	yes

Multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus have been successfully treated in human clinical trials Human multipotent mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapies are currently being tested in clinical trials for Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, graft-versus-host disease, type 1 diabetes, bone fractures, cartilage damage, and cardiac diseases. Based on these results, several small pilot clinical trials in subjects with advanced MS have demonstrated that MSC administration is safe and provided an early signal of clinical effectiveness. The current aim of clinicians and scientists interested in the development of MSC-based strategies for the treatment of MS is to have the ultimate demonstration in large clinical trials that MSC can inhibit CNS inflammation and foster tissue repair Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) promote functional recovery in experimental models of central nervous system (CNS) pathology and are currently being tested in clinical trials for stroke, multiple sclerosis and CNS injury. Autologous bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) offer significant practical advantages for potential clinical applications in multiple sclerosis (MS). Based on recent experimental data, a number of clinical trials have been designed for the intravenous (IV) and/or intrathecal (ITH) administration of BMSCs in MS patients. Fingolimod is a S1P receptor modulator in MS clinical trials due to systemic anti-inflammatory properties, yet may impact cells within the CNS by crossing the blood-brain barrier.

292	5133b15e5274a5fb0700000b	Are CpG islands located close to housekeeping genes?	our analysis indicates that the association of CGIs with housekeeping genes is not as strong as previously estimated CpG islands are preferentially located at the start of transcription of housekeeping genes and are associated with tissue-specific genes It has been envisaged that CpG islands are often observed near the transcriptional start sites (TSS) of housekeeping genes. These regions represent about 1% of genomic DNA and are generally found in the promoter region of housekeeping genes. CpG islands are stretches of DNA sequence that are enriched in the (CpG)n repeat and are present in close association with all housekeeping genes as well as some tissue-specific genes in the mammalian genome. CpG islands, which are found almost exclusively at the 5'-end of housekeeping genes In housekeeping and many tissue-specific genes, the promoter is embedded in a so-called CpG island. All housekeeping and widely expressed genes have a CpG island covering the transcription start, whereas 40% of the genes with a tissue-specific or limited expression are associated with islands Methylation-free CpG clusters, so-called HTF islands, are most often associated with the promoter regions of housekeeping genes, whereas genes expressed in a single-cell type are usually deficient in these sequences. Unmethylated CpG rich islands are a feature of vertebrate DNA: they are associated with housekeeping and many tissue specific genes. CpG islands were associated with the 5' ends of all housekeeping genes and many tissue-specific genes, and with the 3' ends of some tissue-specific genes.	yes

Some of the most highly conserved sequences occur in genes encoding RNA binding proteins, particularly the RNA splicing-associated SR genes. Differences in sequence conservation between plants and animals are likely to reflect differences in the biology of the organisms, with plants being much more able to tolerate genomic deletions and whole-genome duplication events due, in part, to their far greater fecundity compared with vertebrates.	yes
337	56a8adb0a17756b72f000003	Are there enhancer RNAs (eRNAs)?	"active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). eRNAs are distinct from long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), but these two species of noncoding RNAs may share a similar role in the activation of mRNA transcription  eRNAs may then facilitate enhancer-promoter interaction or activate promoter-driven transcription Enhancer RNAs: a class of long noncoding RNAs synthesized at enhancers Enhancer RNAs and regulated transcriptional programs enhancers have been found to be broadly transcribed, resulting in the production of enhancer-derived RNAs, or eRNAs The emerging roles of eRNAs in transcriptional regulatory networks we found certain enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) regulate chromatin accessibility of the transcriptional machinery at loci encoding master regulators of myogenesis (i.e., MyoD/MyoG), thus suggesting their significance and site-specific impact in cellular programming Enhancer RNAs: the new molecules of transcription  the discovery that distal regulatory elements known as enhancers are transcribed and such enhancer-derived transcripts (eRNAs) serve a critical function in transcriptional activation has added a new dimension to transcriptional regulation eRNAs reach the heart of transcription Recent studies have disclosed the function of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), which are long non-coding RNAs transcribed from gene enhancer regions, in transcriptional regulation. Since the discovery that many transcriptional enhancers are transcribed into long noncoding RNAs termed ""enhancer RNAs"" (eRNAs), their putative role in enhancer function has been debated. Recent studies have revealed that active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) expressed from active enhancers, whose function and action mechanism are yet to be firmly established. In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs).  A subset of enhancers are occupied by RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) and transcribed to produce long non-coding RNAs termed eRNAs.  Very recent evidence has indicted that some eRNAs play a role in initiating or activating transcription, possibly by helping recruit and/or stabilize binding of the general transcription machinery to the proximal promoter of their target genes.  In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation.  Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4. The level of eRNA expression at neuronal enhancers positively correlates with the level of messenger RNA synthesis at nearby genes, suggesting that eRNA synthesis occurs specifically at enhancers that are actively engaged in promoting mRNA synthesis. A function of CBP at enhancers may be to recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), as we also observed activity-regulated RNAPII binding to thousands of enhancers. Notably, RNAPII at enhancers transcribes bi-directionally a novel class of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) within enhancer domains defined by the presence of histone H3 monomethylated at lysine 4.  Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) expressed from active enhancers, whose function and action mechanism are yet to be firmly established. Here we show that eRNAs facilitate the transition of paused RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) into productive elongation by acting as a decoy for the negative elongation factor (NELF) complex upon induction of immediate early genes (IEGs) in neurons. Recent studies have disclosed the function of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), which are long non-coding RNAs transcribed from gene enhancer regions, in transcriptional regulation. Recent studies have revealed that active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). eRNAs are distinct from long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), but these two species of noncoding RNAs may share a similar role in the activation of mRNA transcription. Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are a class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) expressed from active enhancers, In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). However, it has remained unclear whether these eRNAs are functional or merely a reflection of enhancer activation.  Recent studies have revealed that active enhancers are transcribed, producing a class of noncoding RNAs called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). eRNAs are distinct from long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), but these two species of noncoding RNAs may share a similar role in the activation of mRNA transcription."	yes

349	514cbbf9d24251bc05000065	Is there an association between c-reactive protein concentrations and outcomes of subarachnoid hemorrhage patients? 	Besides the baseline characteristics, daily interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin, C-reactive protein levels, and leukocyte counts were prospectively measured until day 14 after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Occurrence of infectious complications and application of therapeutic hypothermia were assessed as confounding factors. The primary end point was outcome after 3 months, assessed by Glasgow Outcome Scale; the secondary end point was the occurrence of DINDs. RESULTS: : During a 3-year period, a total of 138 patients were included. All inflammatory parameters measured were higher in patients with unfavorable outcome (Glasgow Outcome Scale score, 1-3). Twenty-three and 28 patients showed poor outcome and symptomatic vasospasm after SAH, respectively. Both preoperative and postoperative CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with a poor outcome compared with patients with a good outcome (P<0.05). e area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of CRP measured on postoperative day 1 or 2 (CRP POD1-2) for predicting a poor clinical outcome was 0.870, and its cutoff point of 4 mg/dL had a sensitivity of 0.826 and a specificity of 0.843. A high CRP level after aneurysm treatment was associated with severe neurological deterioration on admission, cerebral infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, and surgical decompression (P<0.05). CRP POD1-2, and not the preoperative CRP, was an independent factor in predicting symptomatic vasospasm (P<0.05). In patients with symptomatic vasospasm, an increase in the postoperative CRP was associated with the time profile of developing symptomatic vasospasm. Postoperative CRP, especially CRP POD1-2, can be a useful prognostic factor for both poor outcome and symptomatic vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal SAH. Serum CRP levels were related to severity of aSAH. Patients with lower GCS scores and higher Hunt and Hess and Fisher grades presented statistically significant higher serum CRP levels. Patients with higher serum CRP levels had a less favorable prognosis. Increased serum CRP levels were strongly associated with worse clinical prognosis in this study. After SAH, the value of C-reactive protein (CRP)--an acute phase sensitive inflammatory marker--as a prognostic factor has been poorly studied, with conflicting results. Admission (18.0 ± 35.7 vs 8.5 ± 8.4 mg/l) and postoperative (41.0 ± 40.2 vs 21.1 ± 24.1 mg/l) CRP levels were higher (p < 0.001) in those with a poor outcome than in those with a favourable outcome, but CRP values did not predict delayed cerebral ischaemia or cerebral infarction. Higher increase in CRP level between admission and postoperative morning, however, independently predicted poor outcome (p = 0.004). CRP levels correlate with outcome but do not seem to predict delayed cerebral ischaemia or infarction after SAH. Systemic oxygen consumption is associated with hsCRP levels in the first 14 days after SAH and is an independent predictor of DCI. Intracranial hypertension was associated with an inflammatory response, indicating activation of the inflammatory cascade in the brain (ECF) and systemic circulation with high IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma levels after SAH, the latter associated with unfavourable outcome. Patients with angiographic vasospasm had higher CRP measurements in serum and CSF, in a statistically significant fashion (p < 0.0001). Additionally, patients with higher CRP levels in serum and CSF had less favorable outcome in this cohort. Furthermore, patients developing angiographically proven vasospasm demonstrated significantly elevated CRP levels in serum and CSF, and increased CRP measurements were strongly associated with poor clinical outcome in this cohort. Finally, serum concentrations of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and hsCRP during the early (P = .0055, P = .0266, and P = .0266) and late (P = .0423, P = .0041, and P = .0004) period were significantly higher in patients with DIND than in patients without DIND. CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and hsCRP during the early and late period following SAH correlate with DIND CRP levels on days 5, 6, 7, and 8 were statistically significantly higher in the group of patients developing a DIND (P < 0.025, P < 0.016, P < 0.011, P < 0.0002). Overall CRP values were higher with increasing severity of the initial ictus according to the Hunt and Hess Scale and to the outcome according to the Glasgow Outcome Scale from day 3 on. The presented data do not prove that WBCs and CRP values have a direct contribution to the pathogenesis of ischemic complications following SAH, but it supports the assertion that inflammation may present a common pathogenic pathway in the development of such complications. The CRP and TGF-beta1 levels in CSF are strongly concerned with communicating hydrocephalus after SAH.	yes
360	531616bdb166e2b806000003	Is c-myc subject to regulation by the circadian clock?	The current study encompasses the investigation of simultaneous expression of four circadian clock genes (Bmal1, Clock, Per1 and Per2) and three clock-controlled cell cycle genes (Myc, Cyclin D1 and Wee1) Our results suggest that aberrant expression of circadian clock genes can lead to aberrant expression of their downstream targets that are involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis and hence may result in manifestation of CLL. Loss of Bmal1 reduced the expression of per1, per2, per3, wee1 and p53. The expression of p21 and c-myc was also altered in certain cell lines. In particular, the proto-oncogene c-Myc has been documented to be under circadian regulation. The circadian expression of c-MYC is modulated by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A in synchronized murine neuroblastoma cells. Our results, using the murine neuroblastoma cell line N2A, show that Per1 and c-Myc steady-state mRNA levels oscillate with the same phase. These experiments demonstrate for the first time that a significant decrease in c-Myc transcript and protein levels can be achieved after a short TSA treatment applied only at specific circadian times. This is also followed by a reduction in the proliferation rate of the cell population. Among the circadian output pathways, the rhythmic sympathetic signaling plays a key role in the central-peripheral timing mechanism that simultaneously activates the cell cycle clock via AP1-controlled Myc induction and p53 via peripheral clock-controlled ATM activation. Jet-lag promptly desynchronizes the central clock-SNS-peripheral clock axis, abolishes the peripheral clock-dependent ATM activation, and activates myc oncogenic potential, leading to tumor development in the same organ systems in wild-type and circadian gene-mutant mice. The results showed that over-expression of Per2 induced not only cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase but also an increase in apoptosis, which was confirmed by characteristic morphological changes, FCM and evident DNA fragmentation. Further experiments confirmed both up-regulation of P53 and down-regulation of CylinB1and C-myc. On the other hand, while P53 was found to be down-regulated. CylinB1 and C-myc were up-regulated. after Per2 knockdown. We also show that BMAL1 epigenetic inactivation impairs the characteristic circadian clock expression pattern of genes such as C-MYC, catalase, and p300 in association with a loss of BMAL1 occupancy in their respective promoters. Per2 mutant (Per2(m/m)) mice show an increase in lymphomas and deregulated expression of cyclin D and c-Myc genes that are key to proliferation control. The expression of cell cycle genes such as Wee1, Cyclins, and c-Myc are under circadian control and could be directly under the regulation of the circadian transcriptional complex. Overexpressed mPER2 also altered the expression of apoptosis-related genes. The mRNA and protein levels of c-Myc, Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2 were downregulated, Temporal expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression, such as c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin A, Mdm-2 and Gadd45alpha is deregulated in mPer2 mutant mice. The temporal expression of genes involved in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppression, such as c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin A, Mdm-2, and Gadd45alpha, is deregulated in mPer2 mutant mice.	yes
362	57135fae1174fb1755000004	Can cffDNA be used for non-invasive testing?	Non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal circulation The identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal circulation has made non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) possible. In recent years, technical advances in the molecular analysis of fetal DNA (e.g., digital PCR and massively parallel sequencing (MPS)) has enabled the successful implementation of noninvasive testing into clinical practice, such as fetal sex assessment, RhD genotyping, and fetal chromosomal aneuploidy detection.With the ability to decipher the entire fetal genome from maternal plasma DNA, we foresee that an increased number of non-invasive prenatal tests will be available for detecting many single-gene disorders in the near future. This review briefly summarizes the technical aspects of the NIPT and application of NIPT in clinical practice. First identified in 1997, cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has just recently been used to detect fetal aneuploidy of chromosomes 13, 18, and 21, showing its potential to revolutionize prenatal genetic testing as a non-invasive screening tool To determine how adults in the United States view non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA testing) in order to help estimate uptake Non-invasive prenatal testing of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma can predict the fetal RhD type in D negative pregnant women The identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal circulation has made non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) possible The effectiveness and clinical utility of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for fetal sex determination using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) was assessed by undertaking a prospective national audit of UK testing The recent release of new, non-invasive prenatal tests for fetal aneuploidy using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has been hailed as a revolution in prenatal testing and has triggered significant commercial interest in the field Non-invasive prenatal aneuploidy testing that utilizes cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) circulating in maternal blood is one example of an innovative technology that promises significant benefits for its intended end users; however, it is currently uncertain whether it will achieve widespread clinical implementation Analysis of cell free fetal (cff) DNA in maternal plasma is used routinely for non invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) of fetal sex determination, fetal rhesus D status and some single gene disorders Non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma is an alternative to invasive prenatal diagnosis (IPD), which carries a 1% risk of miscarriage.  The recent release of new, non-invasive prenatal tests for fetal aneuploidy using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) has been hailed as a revolution in prenatal testing and has triggered significant commercial interest in the field.  The effectiveness and clinical utility of non-invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) for fetal sex determination using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) was assessed by undertaking a prospective national audit of UK testing.  NIFTY (Non-invasive Fetal Trisomy Test) is a non-invasive prenatal test which is used for diagnosing fetal trisomy. The test is based on the analysis of cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) present in the plasma and serum of a pregnant woman. Using non-invasive method of cffDNAs in the shortest time possible, as well as avoiding invasive tests for early determination of fetal gender, provides the opportunity of deciding and employing early treatment for fetuses at risk of genetic diseases. The identification of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal circulation has made non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) possible. To determine how adults in the United States view non-invasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA testing) in order to help estimate uptake. Nowadays, new advances in the use of cell free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma of pregnant women has provided the possibility of applying cffDNA in prenatal diagnosis as a non-invasive method. Non-invasive prenatal testing of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plasma can predict the fetal RhD type in D negative pregnant women. Prevention of contamination following our anti-contamination criteria is a good practice for certain non-invasive sex determination, using cffDNA.	yes

370	54d8f37b4b1fd0d33c000004	Is the HRC Ser96Ala variant associated with sudden cardiac death in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy?	The Ser96Ala genetic variant of HRC is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic DCM and may serve as an independent predictor of susceptibility to arrhythmogenesis in the setting of DCM. The Ser96Ala (S96A) mutation within the histidine rich Ca(2+) binding protein (HRC) has recently been linked to cardiac arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy patients, potentially attributable to an increase in spontaneous Ca(2+) release events. A human genetic variant (Ser96Ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding (HRC) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy. The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers.  HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.

371	5512c91b6a8cde6b7200000b	Are BRAF mutations common in melanoma?	patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. BRAF-mutated melanoma  The RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway has been reported to be activated in over 80% of all cutaneous melanomas, making it the focus of many scientific studies in the melanoma field. Discoveries of mutations and aberrant expression of components in this cascade, in particular, BRAF and NRAS render a deeper understanding of the mechanisms responsible for oncogenesis and provide new therapeutic strategies for this deadly disease.   BRAF-targeted therapies (e.g., vemurafenib, dabrafenib) have showed impressive results in systemic therapy for melanoma harboring activating BRAF V600E mutations.   An independent cohort of 91 archival MUPs was also screened for 46 hot spot mutations highly prevalent in melanoma including BRAF, NRAS, KIT, GNAQ, and GNA11.  a high rate of BRAF (45 of 101, 45%) and NRAS (32 of 101, 32%) mutations, collectively indicating a mutation profile consistent with cutaneous sun-exposed melanomas. Treatment of advanced melanoma has been improved with the advent of the BRAF inhibitors. BRAF is the most prevalent oncogene and an important therapeutic target in melanoma. Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers. Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer.  BRAF mutations have emerged as an important predictive biomarker for metastasized melanoma.  BRAF V600 selective inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of V600 mutation positive metastatic melanoma,  BRAF(V600) mutation-positive melanoma  Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. The treatment of patients with advanced melanoma is rapidly evolving due to an improved understanding of molecular drivers of this disease. Somatic mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alteration found in these tumors.  genetically activated BRAF, is now commonly prescribed for metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF mutation. BRAF inhibitors improve melanoma patient survival, but resistance invariably develops.  BRAF inhibitors elicit rapid antitumor responses in the majority of patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, but acquired drug resistance is almost universal.  Most patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance to selective RAF kinase inhibitors.  BRAF(V600E) mutation confers constitutive BRAK kinase activation in melanoma cells, promoting tumor growth. This discovery led to the development of BRAF kinase inhibitors like vemurafenib and dabrafenib.  (V600)BRAF mutation was identified as an ideal target for clinical therapy due to its indispensable roles in supporting melanoma initiation and progression. The Braf(V600E) mutation has been detected in patients with metastatic melanoma, colon, thyroid, and other cancers. Since the identification of activating BRAF mutations and subsequent development of drugs targeting the mutant BRAF protein, oncologists now need to incorporate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into treatment decisions for their melanoma patient BRAF mutations occur in approximately 8% of all human cancers and approach 50% in melanoma and papillary carcinoma of thyroid. Vemurafenib is a selective and potent small molecule inhibitor of the V600 mutant form of the BRAF protein used in the treatment of melanoma and colorectal cancer. Molecular studies demonstrated that the melanoma was positive for the 1799T>A (V600E) mutation in the BRAF gene. RAF kinase inhibitors have substantial therapeutic effects in patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma. An activating BRAF (V600E) kinase mutation occurs in approximately half of melanomas.  Activating mutations in the BRAF gene occur in approximately 50% of melanomas. More than 70% of BRAF mutations are V600E and 10-30% are V600K. Activating BRAF mutations, leading to constitutive activation of the MAPK signaling pathway, are common in a variety of human cancers. Several small molecule BRAF inhibitors have been developed during the last years and shown promising results in clinical trials, especially for metastatic melanoma, while they have been less effective in colon cancer.  Personalized melanoma medicine has progressed from histopathologic features to serum markers to molecular profiles. Since the identification of activating BRAF mutations and subsequent development of drugs targeting the mutant BRAF protein, oncologists now need to incorporate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into treatment decisions for their melanoma patients. The clinical activity of BRAF inhibitor (BRAF-I) therapy is a major breakthrough in the treatment of metastatic melanoma carrying BRAF mutations.  The discovery of BRAF mutations in melanoma led to the development of BRAF inhibitors for the treatment of advanced melanoma.  BRAF represents one of the most frequently mutated protein kinase genes in human tumours. The mutation is commonly tested in pathology practice. BRAF mutation is seen in melanoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma (including papillary thyroid carcinoma arising from ovarian teratoma), ovarian serous tumours, colorectal carcinoma, gliomas, hepatobiliary carcinomas and hairy cell leukaemia. Indeed, recent clinical trials involving BRAF selective inhibitors exhibited promising response rates in metastatic melanoma patients.  A majority of cutaneous melanomas show activating mutations in the NRAS or BRAF proto-oncogenes, components of the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk (MAPK) signal transduction pathway. The discovery of activating BRAF mutations in ∼50% of all melanomas has proved to be a turning point in the therapeutic management of the disseminated disease. This review summarizes the critical role of BRAF in melanoma pathophysiology, the clinical and pathological determinants of BRAF mutation status and finally addresses the current state of the art of BRAF inhibitors. To better understand the BRAF mutation profile in melanomas, we retrospectively analyzed data from 1112 primary and metastatic melanomas at our institution. The cohort included nonacral cutaneous (n = 774), acral (n = 111), mucosal (n = 26), uveal (n = 23), leptomeningeal (n = 1), and metastatic melanomas of unknown primary site (n = 177). BRAF mutation hotspot regions in exons 11 and 15 were analyzed by pyrosequencing or with the primer extension MassARRAY system. A total of 499 (44.9%) specimens exhibited BRAF mutations, involving exon 15 [497 (99.6%)] or exon 11 [2 (0.4%)]. p.V600E was detected in 376 (75.4%) cases; the remaining 123 (24.6%) cases exhibited non-p.V600E mutations, of which p.V600K was most frequent [86 (17.2%)]. BRAF mutations were more frequent in nonacral cutaneous (51.4%) than acral melanomas [18 (16.2%)] (P < 0.001); however, there was no significant difference among cutaneous histological subtypes. All mucosal, uveal, and leptomeningeal melanomas were BRAF wild type (WT). Recently, it was reported that BRAF mutations are frequent in melanoma. Activating mutations in BRAF are the most common genetic alterations in melanoma. Oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations are frequent in malignant melanoma. Mutation of BRAF is now known to be common in cutaneous melanomas, and raises possible new therapeutic options of anti-RAF treatment for these patients BRAF mutations are common events in a variety of melanocytic nevi and primary cutaneous melanomas Approximately 40-60% of melanomas from Caucasian populations carry activating mutations in the BRAF oncogene, with the most common being the p.Val600Glu (V600E) hotspot mutation in exon 15 Using a cohort of 115 patients with primary invasive melanomas, we show that BRAF mutations are statistically significantly more common in melanomas occurring on skin subject to intermittent sun exposure than elsewhere (23 of 43 patients; P<.001, two-sided Fisher's exact test) BRAF mutations have been identified as the most common oncogene mutation in melanomas, especially important in those originating on nonchronically sun-damaged skin. 	yes
406	5139ec51bee46bd34c000006	Do Conserved noncoding elements act as enhancers?	The aCNEs are rich in tissue-specific enhancers Transgenic zebrafish assay of some human CNE enhancers that have been lost in teleosts Conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in vertebrate genomes often act as developmental enhancers, In all four cases where the zebra fish and human CNE display a similar expression pattern in zebra fish, the human CNE also displays a similar expression pattern in mouse. This suggests that the endogenous enhancer activity of ∼30% of human CNEs can be determined from experiments in zebra fish If these ancient CNEs are indeed enhancers directing tissue-specific expression of Hox genes, divergence of their sequences in vertebrate lineages might have led to altered expression patterns and presumably the functions of their associated Hox genes. Comparisons of noncoding sequences of the elephant shark and human Hox clusters have identified a large number of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs), which represent putative cis-regulatory elements that may be involved in the regulation of Hox genes. Animal genomes possess highly conserved cis-regulatory sequences that are often found near genes that regulate transcription and development. We test 42 of our PCNEs in transgenic zebrafish assays--including examples from vertebrates and amphioxus--and find that the majority are functional enhancers. The genomes of vertebrates, flies, and nematodes contain highly conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). CNEs cluster around genes that regulate development, and where tested, they can act as transcriptional enhancers. , we identified 17 highly conserved noncoding elements, 9 of which revealed specific acetylation marks in chromatin-immunoprecipitation and microarray (ChIP-chip) assays performed across 250 kb of the Lmo2 locus in 11 cell types covering different stages of hematopoietic differentiation. All candidate regulatory regions were tested in transgenic mice. An extended LMO2 proximal promoter fragment displayed strong endothelial activity, while the distal promoter showed weak forebrain activity. Eight of the 15 distal candidate elements functioned as enhancers, Pan-vertebrate developmental cis-regulatory elements are discernible as highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) and are often dispersed over large areas around the pleiotropic genes whose expression they control. HCNEs of both human and zebrafish function as specific developmental enhancers in zebrafish. several transcriptional enhancers are conserved between amphioxus and vertebrates--a very wide phylogenetic distance. We recently described GRBs in vertebrates, where most HCNEs function as enhancers Besides developmental regulators that are likely targets of HCNE enhancers We identify and characterize highly conserved noncoding elements flanking the TNF gene, which undergo activation-dependent intrachromosomal interactions. These elements, hypersensitive site (HSS)-9 and HSS+3 (9 kb upstream and 3 kb downstream of the TNF gene, respectively), contain DNase I hypersensitive sites in naive, T helper 1, and T helper 2 primary T cells. Both HSS-9 and HSS+3 inducibly associate with acetylated histones, indicative of chromatin remodeling, bind the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)p in vitro and in vivo, and function as enhancers We used the sequence signatures identified by this approach to successfully assign tissue-specific predictions to approximately 328,000 human-mouse conserved noncoding elements in the human genome. By overlapping these genome-wide predictions with a data set of enhancers validated in vivo, in transgenic mice, we were able to confirm our results with a 28% sensitivity and 50% precision. Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be cis-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those tested in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated with genes involved in transcriptional regulation of development. uncovered two anciently conserved noncoding sequences (CNS) upstream of COUP-TFII (CNS-62kb and CNS-66kb). Testing these two elements using reporter constructs in liver cells (HepG2) revealed that CNS-66kb, but not CNS-62kb, yielded robust in vitro enhancer activity.	yes
417	51682382298dcd4e51000066	Does triiodothyronine play a regulatory role in insulin secretion from pancreas?	Our findings establish that p43 is an important regulator of glucose homeostasis and pancreatic β-cell function and provide evidence for the first time of a physiological role for a mitochondrial endocrine receptor. The p43(-/-) mice had a major defect in insulin secretion both in vivo and in isolated pancreatic islets and a loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We demonstrated that treatment of primary cultures of rat pancreatic islets with T3 results in augmented β-cell vitality with an increase of their functional properties. Nonetheless, the insulin secretion is sensibly augmented after T3 stimulation. Plasma glucose concentration of the fetal hypothyroid group during intravenous glucose tolerance test was significantly higher (p=0.003) at 5-20 min as compared to the control group, whereas plasma insulin concentration was significantly lower (p=0.012) at 5-20 min Although adult offspring born from hypothyroid mothers were euthyroid, their glucose tolerance and glucose stimulated insulin secretion of islets were altered hyroid hormones modulate the immune system and metabolism, influence insulin secretion Only T(3) concentrations higher than 250 microM were able to decrease cell viability and proliferation rate, to increase the rate of apoptosis and to reduce glucose-induced insulin secretion. Islets preincubated with glucose (3.3 mmol/l) and glucagon (1.4 mumol/l) plus theophylline (10 mmol/l), ACTH (0.11 nmol/l), bovine GH (0.46 mumol/l), prolactin (0.2 mumol/l) or tri-iodothyronine (1.0 nmol/l) have significantly lower Ca(2+)-ATPase activity than those preincubated with only 3.3 mmol glucose/l. All these hormones increased the release of insulin significantly. T3 (0.2 nM) did not affect insulin secretion in the absence or presence of glucose or in the presence of secretagogues (potassium and glyceraldehyde). In the perfused rat pancreas, the addition of thyroxine (10 micrograms/dL) or 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (150 ng/dL) to the perfusing medium did not affect insulin secretion. The administration of thyroxine (40 micrograms/kg, s.c.) in vivo increased the plasma insulin level from 11 +/- 2 microUnits/mL (mean +/- SD) to 30 +/- 7 microUnits/mL Addition of T3 to the incubation medium, significantly modified the insulin release, but its effect varied according to the glucose concentration in the medium, i.e. it enhanced the insulin release at a glucose concentration between 2 to 8 mmol/l; it has no effect at 12 mmol/glucose, and significantly inhibited the secretion of insulin in the presence of 16.6 mmol/l glucose.

Overall, these experiments point to a neurodegenerative but antiapoptotic effect of endogenous ghrelin in this model of global ischemia, highlighting that further research is essential before we can apply ghrelin treatments to neurodegenerative insults in the clinic.  The serum ghrelin level was higher in the MCAO group when compared with the control group (P < 0.05).  Our results showed that higher level of serum ghrelin decreased gastrointestinal motility and damage to the intestinal mucosa existed in rats with MCAO. Leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin, new potential mediators of ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Significantly higher levels of leptin and lower levels of adiponectin and ghrelin were confirmed in the stroke group. Ghrelin levels correlated mildly with triglyceride levels, and were dominant in men with cardioembolic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Adipokines and ghrelin play an important role in ischemic stroke, but their function in stroke subtypes seems to be different and sex influenced. Ghrelin suppresses inflammation and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in focal cerebral ischemia via the vagus nerve. Compared with vehicle treatment, human ghrelin treatment in vagus nerve-intact rats after MCAO showed marked reduction in neurological deficit by 57% and infarct size by 25%.  Human ghrelin treatment in vagus nerve-intact rats significantly decreased the above measurements. Human ghrelin treatment also improved 7-day survival and significantly decreased neurological deficit over the entire 7 days after MCAO in vagus nerve-intact rats compared with vehicle.  Human ghrelin is thus a neuroprotective agent that inhibits inflammation, nNOS activity, and apoptosis in focal cerebral ischemia through a vagal pathway. Ghrelin is known to promote neuronal defense and survival against ischemic injury by inhibiting apoptotic processes.  Our data indicate that des-acyl ghrelin, as well as ghrelin, protect cortical neurons against ischemic injury through the inhibition of Par-4 expression and apoptotic molecules in mitochondrial pathway. In conclusion, it is considered that ghrelin as well as S-100B can be a useful marker for the prediction of stoke after CPB.  Adipokines and ghrelin play an important role in ischemic stroke, but their function in stroke subtypes seems to be different and sex influenced. In this review we discuss pre-clinical evidence suggesting ghrelin may be a useful therapeutic in protecting the brain against injury after ischemic stroke. Both ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin protected cortical neurons from ischemic injury. Our data indicate that des-acyl ghrelin, as well as ghrelin, protect cortical neurons against ischemic injury through the inhibition of Par-4 expression and apoptotic molecules in mitochondrial pathway.

439	52e7870a98d023950500001a	Is the PTPN22 gene a biomarker for Rheumatoid Arthritis?	"Combined longitudinal analysis of the 2 cohorts suggests further association of several loci with Larsen score (KIF5A, PTPN22, AFF3, TAGAP) and therefore a significant accumulation of RA severity markers among RA susceptibility markers (p = 0.016) A non-intronic marker at TNFAIP3, GIN1/C5orf30, STAT4, ANKRD55/IL6ST, BLK and PTPN22 showed association with RA susceptibility, irrespective of the serological status, the latter three markers remaining significantly associated with anti-CCP negative RA, after correction for multiple testing A C-to-T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at position 1858 of human PTPN22 cDNA and converting an arginine (R620) to tryptophan (W620) confers the highest risk of rheumatoid arthritis among non-HLA genetic variations that are known to be associated with this disease In addition, how the overall activity of PTPN22 is regulated and how the R-to-W conversion contributes to rheumatoid arthritis is still poorly understood Our data depict a model that can reconcile the conflicting observations on the functional impact of the C1858T SNP and also suggest that PTPN22.6 is a novel biomarker of rheumatoid arthritis. Lack of association of common variants in PTPN22 with RA in Han Chinese was confirmed This study identifies MMEL1 and CTLA4 as RA susceptibility genes, provides suggestive evidence of association for a further six loci in the Han Chinese population and confirms lack of PTPN22 association in Asian populations PTPN22 R620W genotype-phenotype correlation analysis and gene-environment interaction study in early rheumatoid arthritis: results from the ESPOIR cohort  PTPN22 620W risk allele was associated with ACPA production [odds ratio (OR) = 2.21, 95% CI 1.4, 3.4, P < 0.0001] Hormonal treatment exposition and smoking were found to act with a protective effect against ACPA production (OR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.3, 0.7, P = 0.001) and early bone erosion (OR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.4-0.8, P = 0.003), respectively, and independently of HLADR and PTPN22 status  RA patients (n=333) and controls (n=490) from the Cree/Ojibway NAN population in Central Canada were HLA-DRB1 typed and tested for 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have previously been associated with RA, including PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, CTLA4, PADI4, STAT4, FCRL3, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, KIF5A-PIP4K2C, IL2RB, TNFAIP3, IL10-1082G/A and REL Several other genes, including PTPN22 and PADI4, show modest association with RA Other variants in potentially pathogenic genes located in non-MHC regions have been implicated by recently performed genome wide analysis studies. These genes include PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, PADI4, STAT4 Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role. CD40, STAT4, PRM1, and TNFAIP3 also seem to be of relevance. HLA-DRB1 and the R620W single-nucleotide polymorphism of PTPN22 were genotyped In addition, evidence of a significant interaction between the shared epitope and the risk allele of PTPN22 was observed only in these patients Although SNPs in PADI4 had similar allele frequency among three groups [maximal difference 11%; (P >0.05)], the other three loci revealed statistically significant allele frequency differences (maximal difference 39% (P <0.00001), 13% (P <0.00001), and 8% (P <0.00001) in SLC22A4, PDCD1, and PTPN22, respectively) Several multiple, large-scale, genetic studies on autoimmune-disease-associated SNPs have been reported recently: peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA); solute carrier family 22 members 4 and 5 (SLC22A4 and 5) in RA and Crohn's disease (CD); programmed cell death 1 (PDCD1) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), and RA; and protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) in T1D, RA, and SLE  Recently a number of convincing candidate genes have begun to emerge and an update has been provided for three of these: PTPN22, CTLA-4 and MIF. Association studies support a role for several genes, including TNFR2, PADI4, SLC22A4, RUNX1, and PTPN22 Analyses of families with multiple autoimmune disorders have revealed a functional polymorphism, 620W, in the intracellular tyrosine phosphatase gene PTPN22 as a predisposing factor for type 1 diabetes, seropositive rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Hashimoto thyroiditis, and the presence of the PTPN22 protein appears to herald the development of autoantibodies in these disorders Replication of putative candidate-gene associations with rheumatoid arthritis in >4,000 samples from North America and Sweden: association of susceptibility with PTPN22, CTLA4, and PADI4. We found strong evidence of an association of PTPN22 with the development of anti-citrulline antibody-positive RA (odds ratio [OR] 1.49; P=.00002), using previously untested EIRA samples.  Exploration of our data set with clinically relevant subsets of RA reveals that PTPN22 is associated with an earlier age at disease onset (P=.004) and that PTPN22 has a stronger effect in males than in females (P=.03)  Given the strong statistical power to replicate a true-positive association in this study, our results provide support for PTPN22, CTLA4, and PADI4 as RA susceptibility genes and demonstrate novel associations with clinically relevant subsets of RA In logistic regression analysis, ACPA predicted RA-development independent of PTPN22, while the PTPN22 polymorphism had no independent effect. Risk of progression from undifferentiated arthritis to rheumatoid arthritis: the effect of the PTPN22 1858T-allele in anti-citrullinated peptide antibody positive patients Anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) and the C1858T missense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the PTPN22 gene are both associated with the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Associations between human leukocyte antigen, PTPN22, CTLA4 genotypes and rheumatoid arthritis phenotypes of autoantibody status, age at diagnosis and erosions in a large cohort study HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (HLA-SE), PTPN22 and CTLA4 alleles are associated with cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Auto-antibodies, HLA and PTPN22: susceptibility markers for rheumatoid arthritis The combination of the PTPN22 1858T variant and anti-CCP antibodies gave a high specificity for the disease, and was significantly associated with RA (P = 8.86 x 10(-5), OR 10.05, 95% CI 1.88-53.73) The combination of the T variant of the 1858 polymorphism of the PTPN22 gene in combination with the presence of anti-CCP antibodies, preferentially in a SE-positive individual, is associated with the development of RA No association of the PTPN22 gene with mortality was detected Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association of the HLA-DRB1 (including the shared epitope [SE]) and PTPN22 genes with the risk of death from all causes and from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to assess the interactions between SE, smoking, and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) status, adjusted by age at symptom onset and sex The disease association of the common 1858C>T Arg620Trp (rs2476601) nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of protein tyrosine phosphatase; nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) on chromosome 1p13 has been confirmed in type 1 diabetes and also in other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and Graves' disease To evaluate the predictive values for disease progression of various antibodies against citrullinated peptide proteins (ACPA) and their relation to PTPN22 1858C/T polymorphism and HLA-DRB1 alleles in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) PTPN22, PADI-4, and CTLA-4 have been associated with risk for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) A significant multiplicative interaction between PTPN22 and smoking for more than 10 pack-years was observed (P = 0.04) No gene-gene interaction was observed between PTPN22 and HLA-SE After adjusting for smoking and reproductive factors, PTPN22 was associated with RA risk among Caucasian women in these cohorts. We found both additive and multiplicative interactions between PTPN22 and heavy cigarette smoking. Weak evidence for an effect at the PTPN22 locus was also observed Association of the PTPN22 gene (-1123G > C) polymorphism with rheumatoid arthritis in Chinese patients These data suggest, the CC genotype and C allele of the -1123G > C in the PTPN22 gene are associated with an increased risk for RA in Chinese population Therefore, the CC genotype and C allele of the -1123G > C in the PTPN22 gene may be used as a genetic marker for the predisposition of RA in Chines A longer duration of breastfeeding increased the risk of developing RA, especially among individuals seropositive for ACPA or IgM-RF or carrying the PTPN22 1858T variant In a multiple logistic regression analysis, increasing time of breastfeeding (OR 9.5, 95% CI 2.14-42.43 for ≥ 17 months), seropositivity for ACPAs (OR 19.5, 95% CI 4.47-84.81), and carriage of the PTPN22 1858T variant (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.36-7.54) remained significant predictors of RA After quality control, 3209 patients and 3692 controls were included in the study. Eight markers (ie, rs1160542 (AFF3), rs1678542 (KIF5A), rs2476601 (PTPN22), rs3087243 (CTLA4), rs4810485 (CD40), rs5029937 (6q23), rs10760130 (TRAF1/C5) and rs7574865 (STAT4)) were significantly associated with RA by meta-analysis Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on RA identified known and novel susceptibility genes like HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, TRAF1/C5, OLIG3/TNFAIP3, CD40, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, IL2RB, and KIF5A-PIP4K2C In the total RA inception cohort, the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope (per-allele odds ratio (OR) = 2.1, trend P < 0.0001), PTPN22 (per-allele OR = 1.5, trend P < 0.0001), OLIG3/TNFAIP3 locus (per-allele OR = 1.2, trend P = 0.009) and TRAF1/C5 locus (per-allele OR = 1.1, trend P = 0.04) were associated with RA Progress has been made in determining the relative contributions and the interaction of the shared epitope, PTPN22 and smoking in conferring the risk of anticitrullinated protein antibodies-positive and negative RA Homozygous and heterozygous carriers of the PTPN22 1858T allele had a decreased probability of remission Our analyses have confirmed previous findings for genes PTPN22 and C5 Fifty-five percent of the FDRs had > or =1 copy of the shared epitope, 20% had > or =1 copy of the PTPN22 polymorphism, and approximately 16% were positive for rheumatoid factor (RF; including isotypes) and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody As an effect several new genes have been recognized as an HLA-independent genetic risk factors of RA. PTPN22 gene polymorphism, C5/TRAF1 genes region polymorphism and TNFAIP3-OLIG3 genes region polymorphism(s) are among newly identified and already confirmed genetic risk factors, whereas STAT 4, CTLA4, PADI4 and IRF5 genes polymorphisms are listed among probable RA development genetic risk factors Patients were analysed for anti-MCV and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), and were genotyped for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRB1 ""shared epitope"" (SE) and protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) 1858T As well as the major susceptibility gene HLA-DRB1, recent genome-wide and candidate-gene studies reported additional evidence for association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5 loci with RA However, we were able to replicate the association signals between RA and HLA-DRB1 alleles, STAT4 (rs7574865), PTPN22 (rs2476601) and OLIG3/TNFAIP3 (rs10499194 and rs6920220) Additionally, SNPs rs7574865STAT4 (P = 9.2*10-6; OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.35 - 2.18) and rs2476601PTPN22 (P = 9.5*10-4; OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.23 - 2.26) were associated with susceptibility to RA, whereas after permutation testing OLIG3/TNFAIP3 SNPs rs10499194 and rs6920220 missed our criteria for significance (Pcorr = 0.114 and Pcorr = 0.180, respectively In our Slovak population, HLA-DRB1 alleles as well as SNPs in STAT4 and PTPN22 genes showed a strong association with RA Currently, 5 loci (HLA, PTPN22, TRAF1/C5, TNFAIP3, and STAT4) have been consistently reported, whereas others have been observed less systematically Genetic markers such as shared epitope alleles and PTPN22 1858T variant increase the relative risk for disease development Particularly, ACPAs in combination with human leukocyte antigen-shared epitope alleles and PTPN22 1858T carriage increased the relative risks of developing RA compared with not having these factors However, inconsistent results of the contributions of non-HLA susceptibility genes have been described, with the exception of a few genes repeatedly associated with RA-susceptibility, such as PTPN22 gene in populations of European ancestry and PADI4 gene in populations of Asian ancestry, revealing the presence of genetic heterogeneity in RA Functional polymorphisms of PTPN22 and FcgR genes in Tunisian patients with rheumatoid arthritis We found strong evidence of an association of PTPN22 620W allele and RA In conclusion, we have confirmed that PTPN22 620W allele is associated with Tunisian RA but does not constitute a factor influencing clinical manifestations The C1858T allele of the PTPN22 gene has been reported to confer risk for RA Similarly, the presence or absence of the HLA-DRB1 shared epitope or the RA-associated PTPN22 allele had no influence on this association Although some genetic risk factors for RA are well-established, most notably HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22, these markers do not fully account for the observed heritability Lastly, in combination with the other two known genetic risk factors, HLA-DRB1 and PTPN22, the variants reported here generate more than a 45-fold RA-risk differential Contribution of PTPN22 1858T, TNFRII 196R and HLA-shared epitope alleles with rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies to very early rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis PTPN22 1858T, TNFRII 196R and HLA-SE alleles do not improve the predictive value of RF and ACPA for RA diagnosis in our cohort, and do not contribute to an earlier diagnosis in undifferentiated patients initially negative for RF and ACPA"	yes
452	58848a13e56acf517600000d	Is there a role of regorafenib for sarcoma treatment?	Regorafenib has been approved for third-line therapy. Study protocol of REGOSARC trial: activity and safety of regorafenib in advanced soft tissue sarcoma: a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase II trial. DISCUSSION: The design of this trial allows an assessment of regorafenib activity over placebo in four sarcoma strata and might provide evidence for launching a phase III trial. This case provides rationale for adding a Ewing sarcoma arm to SARC024, a phase II study of regorafenib, another multi-targeted kinase inhibitor, in patients with liposarcoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing and Ewing-like sarcomas (NCT02048371). Thus, the Phase III studies with pazopanib, regorafenib, muramyl tripeptide (MTP) and ridaforolimus are extensively discussed as well as the biological rationale for the use of these compounds. Currently, regorafenib is examined in several clinical trials (mostly phase II) in different tumor entities, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and soft tissue sarcoma (STS). Analysis of primary human sarcoma samples revealed direct cytotoxicity following exposure to sorafenib and regorafenib with a corresponding increase in ALDHbright cells (P<0.05). Parametric and non-parametric statistical analyses were performed as appropriate.RESULTS: After functionally validating the CSC phenotype of ALDHbright sarcoma cells, we observed that sorafenib and regorafenib were cytotoxic to sarcoma cell lines (P<0.05), with a corresponding 1.4 - 2.8 fold increase in ALDHbright cells from baseline (P<0.05). We evaluated survival and CSC phenotype in mice harboring sarcoma metastases after TKI therapy. We exposed dissociated primary sarcoma tumors to sorafenib, regorafenib, and pazopanib, and we used tissue microarray (TMA) and primary sarcoma samples to evaluate the frequency and intensity of CSC markers after neoadjuvant therapy with sorafenib and pazopanib. Parametric and non-parametric statistical analyses were performed as appropriate.RESULTS: After functionally validating the CSC phenotype of ALDHbright sarcoma cells, we observed that sorafenib and regorafenib were cytotoxic to sarcoma cell lines (P<0.05), with a corresponding 1.4 - 2.8 fold increase in ALDHbright cells from baseline (P<0.05).

464	588485bbe56acf517600000b	Is rucaparib used for ovarian cancer treatment?	While olaparib is the first PARP inhibitor to receive approval for ovarian cancer treatment, others including rucaparib and niraparib are clearly effective in this disease and, within the next year or two, the results of ongoing randomised trials will clarify their respective roles.  Similar trials with other PARP inhibitors (rucaparib, niraparib and veliparib) are in progress and include non-BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer.  IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib has recently received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), with a second agent (rucaparib) likely to be approved in the near future. Ovarian Cancers Harbour Defects in Non-Homologous End Joining Resulting in Resistance to Rucaparib. There are a number of other PARP inhibitors in late phase clinical development in ovarian cancer including rucaparib, niraparib, veliparib, and talazoparib.  Rucaparib in relapsed, platinum-sensitive high-grade ovarian carcinoma (ARIEL2 Part 1): an international, multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial. INTERPRETATION: In patients with BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and LOH high platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinomas treated with rucaparib, progression-free survival was longer than in patients with BRCA wild-type LOH low carcinomas. Our results suggest that assessment of tumour LOH can be used to identify patients with BRCA wild-type platinum-sensitive ovarian cancers who might benefit from rucaparib.  Genomic LOH May Predict Rucaparib Response in Ovarian Cancer. High LOH is associated with response to the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in BRCA wild-type ovarian cancer.

These results support further clinical evaluation of rucaparib either as a single agent or as an adjunct to chemotherapy for the treatment of sporadic ovarian cancer. Ongoing clinical trials are assessing the efficacy of rucaparib alone or in combination with other cytotoxic drugs, mainly in breast and ovarian cancer patients with mutations in the breast cancer associated (BRCA) genes.PURPOSE: We aimed to establish whether the multidrug efflux transporters ABCG2 (BCRP) and ABCB1 (P-gp, MDR1) affect the oral availability and brain penetration of rucaparib in mice.RESULTS: In vitro, rucaparib was efficiently transported by both human ABCB1 and ABCG2, and very efficiently by mouse Abcg2.

491	58bfeb2b02b8c6095300001a	Is butterfly rash a symptom of Systemic lupus erythematosus?	"Diagnosing SLE can be challenging because of the myriad of clinical features and substantial variability between patients. Cutaneous involvement is present in about 60% of cases and typically manifests as a malar or butterfly rash. The prevalence of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is 28 per 100,000.  We report a 12 years old female patient with an overlap syndrome involving autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient presented with jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, malaise, polyarthralgia, arthritis and butterfly rash on the face. Some of the clinical characteristics of SLE patients observed were nephritis (53.7%), fever (53.26%), neuropsychological disorder (36.18%), malar/butterfly rash (27.6%), pulmonary disorder (22.6%), photosensitivity (21.6%), cardiac involvement (21.1%) and oral ulcers (19.09%).  Systemic lupus erythematosus and infections: a retrospective study in Saudis. The prevalence of the following manifestations was significantly higher for pediatric than for adult-onset disease including: lupus nephritis (43% pediatric vs 26.4% for adult-onset), hematological disorders (57% vs 36.4%), photosensitivity (20% vs 9%), butterfly rash (61% vs 35.5%) and mucosal ulceration (11.4% vs 4%).  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease with highest prevalence among women of childbearing age.  We described a unique case of a 25-year-old Arab young woman who was diagnosed with SLE, depending on clinical, laboratory investigations and after she had fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for SLE and had presented the following findings: constitutional findings (fatigue, fever, and arthralgia); dermatologic finding (photosensitivity and butterfly rash); chronic renal failure (proteinuria up to 400 mg in 24 hours); hematologic and antinuclear antibodies (positivity for antinuclear factor (ANF), anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, direct Coombs, ANA and anti-DNA, low C4 and C3, aCL by IgG and IgM).  Grade 1 and 2-3 inflammatory process occurred in 53 (63%) and 31 (37%) patients respectively. Symptom complexes ""systemic inflammation"", ""butterfly rash"", ""wrist petechiae"", ""enanthema of the oral mucous membrane"", and other lesions were regarded as the markers of SLE activity.  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) remains a challenging medical problem.  Rembrandt's Maria Bockenolle has a butterfly rash and digital deformities: overlapping syndrome of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. A butterfly rash on the patient's face suggested a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A butterfly rash on the patients face suggested a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) The diagnosis of SLE could be excluded and the butterfly rash attributed to a laminar hemorrhage, an ecchymosis due to the autoimmune thrombocytopenia. We describe a case of KD who developed a typical butterfly rash, reminiscent of SLE.  The diagnosis of SLE was made 22 years ago based on Raynaud's phenomenon, butterfly rash, hair loss, photosensitivity and positive antinuclear antibody.  Symptom complexes ""systemic inflammation"", ""butterfly rash"", ""wrist petechiae"", ""enanthema of the oral mucous membrane"", and other lesions were regarded as the markers of SLE activity. Rembrandt's Maria Bockenolle has a butterfly rash and digital deformities: overlapping syndrome of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

503	58cdb80302b8c60953000043	Is Doxorubicin cardiotoxic?	Doxorubicin (DOXO) is widely used to treat solid tumors. However, its clinical use is limited by side effects including serious cardiotoxicity due to cardiomyocyte damage.  The results provide direct evidence for the role of catalase in doxorubicin cardiotoxic responses. These results do not support the possibility that mitomycin C potentiates the acute cardiotoxic effects produced by doxorubicin. The anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin is converted by the enzyme carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) into its cardiotoxic metabolite doxorubicinol The clinical efficiency of the highly potent antitumor agent doxorubicin is limited by cardiotoxic effects Doxorubicin (DOX), a highly active chemotherapeutic drug, faces limitations in clinical application due to severe cardiotoxic effects (mainly through increased oxidative stress) Clinical uses of doxorubicin (DOX), a highly active anticancer agent, are limited by its severe cardiotoxic side effects associated with increased oxidative stress and apoptosis Doxorubicin (DOX) and trastuzumab (TRZ) are highly effective chemotherapeutic agents in the breast cancer setting, limited by their cardiotoxic side effects Twisting and ironing: doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by mitochondrial DNA damage. Cardiotoxic effects were reported in 15 (5%) of 291 children receiving treatment including doxorubicin. On the other hand, pretreatment of rats with hesperidin protected cardiac tissues against the cardiotoxic effects of doxorubicin as evidenced from amelioration of histopathological changes and normalization of cardiac biochemical parameters.Hesperidin may have a protective effect against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. However, with cumulative doses, doxorubicin also is known to have cardiotoxic effects, including cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Methods of reducing or preventing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity have been suggested, including an investigational doxorubicin analog, mitoxantrone ( Novantrone ). The most cardiotoxic drug, doxorubicin, is the most potent inducer of superoxide generation, while epirubicin, which is less cardiotoxic, has a relatively limited effect on superoxide production. The mechanism of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is likely multifactorial and most importantly, the genetic factors predisposing to doxorubicin cardiotoxicity are unknown. As doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is considered irreversible, early detection of cardiotoxicity and prevention of overt heart failure is essential. Although there are monitoring guidelines for cardiotoxicity, optimal timing for early detection of subclinical doxorubicin cardiotoxicity is still obscure. Quercetin attenuates doxorubicin cardiotoxicity by modulating Bmi-1 expression. However, doxorubicin cardiotoxicity of the heart has largely limited its clinical use. Mitochondrial topoisomerase I (top1mt) is a novel limiting factor of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin-based chemotherapy induces cardiotoxicity, which limits its clinical application. he clinical use of doxorubicin (DOX) and other anthracyclines is limited by a dosage-dependent cardiotoxicity, which can lead to cardiomyopathy.  Besides its cardiotoxic effect, doxorubicin also elicits inflammatory effects in vivo. 7-Monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER) has recently been used as a protector against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo. Doxorubicin is an effective antineoplastic agent, but it frequently causes dose-related cardiotoxic effects.  Among these analogs, idarubicin (4-demethoxy-daunorubicin) was shown to be less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin i Verapamil has also been suggested to potentiate the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin.  Doxorubicin treatment is associated with both acute and chronic cardiotoxicity.  cardiac effects of diclofenac sodium on doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in rats	yes
515	58ca906a02b8c6095300002e	Do brown fat cells produce heat?	"WAT and BAT are both involved in energy balance. WAT is mainly involved in the storage and mobilization of energy in the form of triglycerides, whereas BAT specializes in dissipating energy as heat during cold- or diet-induced thermogenesis. Because brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy in the form of heat, increasing energy expenditure by augmenting BAT-mediated thermogenesis may represent an approach to counter obesity and its complications. Classic brown fat and inducible beige fat both dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat through the actions of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1. This nonshivering thermogenesis is crucial for mammals as a defense against cold and obesity/diabetes. Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 in brown fat cells produces heat by dissipating the energy generated by fatty acid and glucose oxidation. Brown fat biology and thermogenesis. Brown fat (brown adipose tissue, BAT) primary function is to produce heat.  Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production. Calorimetric measurements from cell suspensions showed that ATP increased basal heat production of isolated brown fat cells by approximately 40% but had no effect on the greater than fivefold increase in heat production seen with maximal adrenergic stimulation. Classic brown fat and inducible beige fat both dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat through the actions of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1. Brown adipocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or to excessive energy intake; stimulation of brown fat development and function may thus counteract obesity. The occurrence of Types 1 and/or 6 cells that has been revealed in 65 out of the total 180 samples (36%), suggests that the oxidation of fat for the thermogenesis proceeds in the brown fat tissue and that brown fat cells partially undergo fat depletion. Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production. In response to cold, both classical brown fat and the newly identified ""beige"" or ""brite"" cells are activated by β-adrenergic signaling and catabolize stored lipids and carbohydrates to produce heat via UCP1 The ability of brown adipocytes (fat cells) to dissipate energy as heat shows great promise for the treatment of obesity and other metabolic disorders Inappropriate heat dissipation ignites brown fat thermogenesis in mice with a mutant thyroid hormone receptor α1 Brown fat and vascular heat dissipation: The new cautionary tail Brown adipose produces heat as a defense against hypothermia and obesity, and the appearance of brown-like adipocytes within white adipose tissue depots is associated with improved metabolic phenotypes.  In the same manner, marked ability to produce a considerable amount of heat was evidenced in  brown fat tissue of children and teenagers.  Brown fat cells were classified into 6 types: Type 1 cells are fat-depleted cells filled with granular cytoplasm and are believed to be produced after oxidation of fat for heat production.  It is inferred that brown-adipose-tissue heat production is reduced during (and probably also some time after) anesthesia.  Parallel measurements of heat production and thermogenin content in brown fat cells during cold acclimation of rats. The classical white adipose tissue builds up energy in the form of triglycerides and is useful for preventing fatigue during periods of low caloric intake and the brown adipose tissue instead of inducing fat accumulation can produce energy as heat. In response to cold, both classical brown fat and the newly identified ""beige"" or ""brite"" cells are activated by β-adrenergic signaling and catabolize stored lipids and carbohydrates to produce heat via UCP1. White adipose tissue stores energy reserves as fat, whereas the metabolic function of brown adipose tissue is lipid oxidation to produce heat. The main function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) is to produce heat in response to cold. Brown adipocytes oxidize fatty acids to produce heat in response to cold or caloric overfeeding. Brown fat (brown adipose tissue, BAT) primary function is to produce heat. Adipose tissue plays an active role in energy balance because it is not only a lipid storing and mobilizing tissue but consists of functionally specialized tissues able to produce heat (in brown adipose tissue) and to produce or release a vast number of so called adipokines or adipocytokines. Brown adipose tissue (BAT), a specialized fat that dissipates energy to produce heat, plays an important role in the regulation of energy balance. Brown adipose cells are specialized to dissipate chemical energy in the form of heat, as a physiological defence against cold and obesity. In the present study, the thermogenesis of human brown fat tissue was suggested chiefly with regard to the occurrence of Types 1 and/or 6 cells. In the same manner, marked ability to produce a considerable amount of heat was evidenced in  brown fat tissue of children and teenagers. Adult humans have heat-producing and energy-consuming brown adipose tissue in the clavicular region of the neck. Brown and beige adipocytes expend chemical energy to produce heat and are therefore important in regulating body temperature and body weight. In human perirenal brown fat tissue, darkly stained fat-depleted cells (D) occupy, with other cell types (CR, CR'), an important part in the reversible heat production cycle of the brown fat tissue. Brown fat is a specialized fat depot that can increase energy expenditure and produce heat."	yes

In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study including 217 patients with primary biliary cholangitis, the authors show that obeticholic acid (a potent farnesoid X agonist) administered with ursodeoxycholic acid or as monotherapy significantly decreases serum alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin when compared to placebo. Obeticholic acid (Ocaliva(TM)) is a farnesoid-X receptor (FXR) agonist that is being developed by Intercept Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of various liver diseases, and has recently been granted accelerated approval in the USA for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid in adults with an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate ursodeoxycholic acid.  Obeticholic Acid (OCA) is a farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonist which has been evaluated as a second line therapy in PBC and has recently been licenced by the FDA. OCA will be the first stratified therapy introduced in PBC, however confirmatory trial and real life data are needed to confirm that suggestive biochemical improvements are matched by improvement in key clinical outcomes. Obeticholic acid for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis in adult patients: clinical utility and patient selection. A series of clinical trials of OCA in PBC, primarily in combination with UDCA, have established that OCA leads to significant reductions in serum alkaline phosphatase that are predicted to lead to improved clinical outcomes, while dose-dependent pruritus has been the most common adverse effect. On the basis of these studies, OCA was given conditional approval by the US Food and Drug Administration with plans to establish the long-term clinical efficacy of OCA in patients with advanced PBC. Although obeticholic acid was approved by the FDA for the treatment of PBC in May 2016, this development occurred after the symposium presentation.  While several agents are being studied in combination with UDCA, monotherapy with the novel agent obeticholic acid, a farnesoid X receptor agonist, has also shown promising results.

638	5a981dd0fcd1d6a10c00002e	Are sleep apnea and snoring associated with cardiac arrhythmias?	Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest arrhythmia in clinical practice and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), a common breathing disorder, is an independent risk factor for AF. There is a growing consensus in the scientific community that suggests a strong association between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and cardiovascular (CVD) conditions and events, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden cardiac death.  part from well-established risk factors that increase the odds for the development of AF, e.g. age or arterial hypertension, recent analyses indicate that obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) may independently, negatively modify the arrhythmia occur-rence profile.  Evidence supports a causal association of sleep apnea with the incidence and morbidity of hypertension, coronary heart disease, arrhythmia, heart failure, and stroke. Severe snoring may be associated with pulmonary and systemic hypertension, secondary polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias.<br> Severe snoring may be associated with pulmonary and systemic hypertension, secondary polycythemia, and cardiac arrhythmias. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), reportedly as a consequence of the autonomic effects of recurrent apnea with subsequent oxygen desaturation. Obstructive apnea is associated with myocardial ischemia (silent or symptomatic), acute coronary events, stroke and transient ischemic attacks, cardiac arrhythmia, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is the most common form of sleep-disordered breathing, affecting 5-15% of the population. It is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway during sleep that disrupts normal ventilation and sleep architecture, and is typically associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, and witnessed apneas. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea present risk to the general public safety by causing 8-fold increase in vehicle accidents, and they may themselves also suffer from the physiologic consequences of OSA; these include hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac arrhythmias Obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration                     are associated with an increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia.  Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects approximately 4% of middle-aged men and 2% of middle-aged women. Cardiac arrhythmias are common problems in patients with OSA, even though the true prevalence and clinical relevance of cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined.  Cardiac arrhythmias during wakefulness and sleep in 15 patients with sleep-induced obstructive apnea, and the effect of atropine and tracheostomy on these arrhythmias were studied by continuous overnight Holter electrocardiographic, respiratory and electroencephalographic recordings. obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as its most extreme variant, is characterized by intermittent episodes of partial or complete obstruction of the upper airway, leading to cessation of breathing while asleep. Cardiac arrhythmias are common problems in OSA patients, although the true prevalence and clinical relevance of cardiac arrhythmias remains to be determined The mechanisms associated with the cardiovascular consequences of obstructive sleep apnea include abrupt changes in autonomic tone, which can trigger cardiac arrhythmias.   Recent studies have shown that cardiac arrhythmias and conduction disorders are common in patients with SA. Sleep apnea Severity of nocturnal cardiac arrhythmias correlates with intensity of sleep apnea in men Patients affected with OSA are frequently hypertensive and can have dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. Patients with stable cardiac failure who snore may present sleep hypopnea and cardiac arrhythmias.   Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cardiac arrhythmias are common in patients with OSA.  Nocturnal hypoxia has been associated with serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias as well as life-threatening bradyarrhythmias. Obesity and snoring, both of which increase with age, have been identified as risk factors for sleep-related breathing disorders, as have hypertension and heart disease. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is associated with excess daytime sleepiness, depression, and an increased incidence of ischemic cardiopathy, cardiac arrhythmias, systemic hypertension and brain infarction. We found 58 percent prevalence of arrhythmias in patients with sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index = AHI>10), vs 42 percent in nonapneic controls (chi 2 = 16.7, p<0.0001)	yes

662	5ac24f7595d0062724000003	Is transcription of eRNA bidirectional?	In addition to widespread transcription of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in mammalian cells, bidirectional ncRNAs are transcribed on enhancers, and are thus referred to as enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Kallikrein-related peptidase 3 (KLK3), which codes for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), is a well-known AR-regulated gene and its upstream enhancers produce bidirectional enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), termed KLK3e. The distal enhancer of the gonadotropin hormone α-subunit gene, chorionic gonadotropin alpha (Cga), is responsible for Cga cell-specific expression in gonadotropes and thyrotropes, and we show here that it encodes two bidirectional nonpolyadenylated RNAs whose levels are increased somewhat by exposure to gonadotropin-releasing hormone but are not necessarily linked to Cga transcriptional activity.  A richer picture has taken shape, integrating transcription of coding genes, enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), and various other noncoding transcriptional events. In this review we give an overview of recent studies detailing the mechanisms of RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II)-based transcriptional initiation and discuss the ways in which transcriptional direction is established as well as its functional implications. XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers. The distal enhancer of the gonadotropin hormone α-subunit gene, chorionic gonadotropin alpha (Cga), is responsible for Cga cell-specific expression in gonadotropes and thyrotropes, and we show here that it encodes two bidirectional nonpolyadenylated RNAs whose levels are increased somewhat by exposure to gonadotropin-releasing hormone but are not necessarily linked to Cga transcriptional activity. Using this approach, we have defined a class of primary transcripts (eRNAs) that are transcribed uni- or bidirectionally from estrogen receptor binding sites (ERBSs) with an average transcription unit length of ∼3-5 kb. XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers. We identify 76 enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), 40 canonical lncRNAs, 65 antisense lncRNAs and 35 regions of bidirectional transcription (RBT) that are differentially expressed in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers. Instead, communication between promoters and enhancers can be bidirectional with promoters required to activate enhancer transcription.

665	5ab144fefcf4565872000012	The TRPM2 gene is associated with development of spontaneous thromboembolism?	TheTransientReceptorPotentialMelastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a member of G protein coupled receptor superfamily and a novel dual-function protein that possesses both ion channel andAdenosine 5'-DiphosPhataseRibose (ADPR) hydrolase function. TRPM2 is involved in Ca2+signaling in various cells as an endogenous redox sensor for oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species, and contributes to cytokine production, insulin release, motility, Ca2+entry and Ca2+-dependent cellular reactions such as endothelial hyper-permeability and apoptosis. We show here that the redox-sensitive transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel TRPM2 is expressed in the phagosomal membrane and regulates macrophage bactericidal activity through the activation of phagosomal acidification The transient receptor potential melastatin-2 (TRPM2) is an oxidative stress sensing channel that is expressed in a number of inflammatory cells and therefore it has been suggested that inhibition of TRPM2 could lead to a beneficial effect in COPD patients. TRPM2 is a recently identified TRPM family cation channel which is unique among known ion channels in that it contains a C-terminal domain which is homologous to the NUDT9 ADP-ribose hydrolase and possesses intrinsic ADP-ribose hydrolase activity These results suggest that TRPM2 may participate in antigen-induced extracellular Ca(2+) influx and subsequent degranulation. In addition, TRPM2 inhibitors were shown to improve food allergic reactions in a mouse model. Together, these results suggest that TRPM2 inhibitors suppress MMC degranulation via regulation of the increase in [Ca(2+)]cyt. Thus, TRPM2 may play a key role in degranulation by modulating intracellular Ca(2+) in MMCs. he Na+ and Ca(2+)-permeable melastatin related transient receptor potential 2 (TRPM2) channels can be gated either by ADP-ribose (ADPR) in concert with Ca(2+) or by hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), an experimental model for oxidative stress, binding to the channel's enzymatic Nudix domain hese alterations of the extracellular milieu change the activity of transient receptor potential melastatin subfamily member 2 (TRPM2), a nonselective cation channel expressed in the central nervous system and the immune system.  TRPM2 (Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 2) is a Ca2+-permeable ion channel that is activated under conditions of oxidative stress.  Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a thermosensitive, Ca2+-permeable cation channel. TRPM2 contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease, and inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We hypothesized that TRPM2 is important for visceral nociception and the development of visceral hypersensitivity. Here, we describe the computational identification of a melanoma-enriched antisense transcript, TRPM2-AS, mapped within the locus of TRPM2, an ion channel capable of mediating susceptibility to cell death The transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel, a Ca(2+)-permeable nonselective cation channel activated by oxidative stress, has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, and more recently in amyloid-induced toxicity Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is a calcium-permeable cation channel activated by ADP-ribose or reactive oxygen species.  Transient receptor potential melastatin type 2 (TRPM2) is a Ca2+ permeable non-selective cation channel expressed in several cell types including hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Moreover, activation of TRPM2 during oxidative stress has been linked to cell death. 	no

Myocardial fibrosis was present in 30% of patients, the majority of which was mid-myocardial (63%).   DCM patients frequently have myocardial fibrosis detected on CE-CMR, the majority of which is mid-myocardial. Fifty (40%) patients showed myocardial DE, representing 12±7% of LV mass. one case was dilated cardiomyopathy, in which the delayed enhancement was diffuse small midwall spots  In the dilated cardiomyopathy group, only seven (29%) patients showed delayed enhancement and its pattern was characterized by mid-wall, patchy or diffuse location. Patterns of delayed enhancement are different in dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy, reflecting the presence of scarring or various degrees of fibrosis in left ventricular myocardium. The presence of subendocardial or transmural delayed enhancement at contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance allowed distinction between dilated cardiomyopathy and ischemic cardiomyopathy with high sensitivity (88%) and specificity (100%).	yes
14	514a4679d24251bc0500005b	Are psammoma bodies characteristic to meningiomas?	Psammoma bodies (PBs) are concentric lamellated calcified structures, observed most commonly in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), meningioma, and papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of ovary but have rarely been reported in other neoplasms and nonneoplastic lesions. Studies on serous cystadenocarcinoma of ovary and meningioma, however, revealed that collagen production by neoplastic cells and subsequent calcification was responsible for the formation of PBs. The existence of some precursor forms of PBs was reported in meningiomas and more recently in PTC, which were mostly in the form of extracellular hyaline globules surrounded by well-preserved neoplastic cells or in a smaller number of cases intracytoplasmic bodies liberated from intact tumor cells. Light microscopy revealed abundant microcysts of varied size throughout the tumor tissue with the presence of whorl formation and psammoma body, but no malignancy was indicated. Electron microscopy further demonstrated interdigitation of the neighboring cell membranes, desmosomes, and intracytoplasmic filaments, which are pathognomonic findings of meningiomas. Unlike SFT, FMs were glycogen-containing and variously exhibited a storiform pattern (13 of 20), psammoma body formation (9 of 20), and calcification of collagen (4 of 20). Immunoreactivities included vimentin (100%), focal to patchy EMA (80%), S-100 protein (80%), collagen IV (25%), and patchy, mild-to-moderate CD34 staining (60%). In contrast to the inner structure, three-dimensional structure of psammona bodies in meningiomas is not well defined. This study examined three cultured meningiomas, in which surface observation of psammoma bodies might be easier than in the tumor tissues since influence of interposing connective tissue is minimized in tissue culture. The results suggest that psammoma bodies in meningiomas arise in part from meningothelial whorls due to collagen production by tumor cells followed by obliteration and disappearance of tumor cell processes, although some of the alternative pathways for psammoma body formation proposed by other investigators cannot be ruled out by this study. To demonstrate that psammoma bodies in human meningiomas contain type VI collagen and laminin. This is the first report to describe the involvement of type VI collagen in psammoma bodies and whorl formations in meningiomas. Calcification such as psammoma body is sometimes found especially in spinal cord meningioma but ossification of the meningeal tumor was rarely observed. Histological diagnosis was transitional meningioma with psammoma body. In this study we analyzed the morphologic and ultrastructural characteristics of the psammoma bodies in ten meningiomas of different histologic subtypes, characterizing the components of the psammoma body and the elements of the tumor, such as the capillaries and degenerative cells that have been classically considered as initiators of the formation of these calcareous is structures. It is concluded that the mineralization of the psammoma bodies is induced principally by the collagen fibers synthesized by the meningocytes and that the form of mineralization is spherical and growth is radial, controlled by the tumoral cells. CSF cytology revealed benign fibroblastic or meningotheliomatous meningioma with whorl formation and psammoma body. Electron microscopic examination of the calculi showed membrane-bound vesicles and radially precipitated crystals that simulated hydroxyapatite of psammoma body in meningioma. Psammoma bodies in meningiomas resembled those in the choroid plexus stroma. The results of this study suggest that psammoma bodies in the choroid plexus, as in meningiomas, form by a process of dystrophic calcification associated with arachnoid cells and collagen fibres. An early stage of psammoma body formation was seen more frequently in these villous microcores than in the meningocytic whorls. Psammoma bodies in meningocytic whorls were investigated by electron microscopy. Psammoma body formation in the meningocytic whorls may represent degeneration in some whorls of the central cells which contain connective tissue fibers, producing cell debris such as membrane invested vesicles. Twenty human meningiomas were examined for IgG and IgM by the direct immunofluorescence of immunoperoxidase methods, or both. IgG was conspicuously found in and around the blood vessels, whorls, and psammoma bodies. It was also clearly present on the cytoplasmic membranes of the tumour cells. Significance of these findings is briefly discussed including possible humoral immune reactions in regard to whorl and psammoma body formation in meningioma. The fine structure of psammoma bodies was examined in four cases of fibroblastic meningioma. In general, large numbers of various-sized calcified bodies (psammoma bodies) were scattered among the interstitial fibers. These findings suggest that both matrix giant bodies and matrix vesicles may serve as initial nidus of calcification of psammoma bodies in fibroblastic meningioma. Psammoma body formation or dystrophic mineralization and gliosis of the intervening parenchyma was observed in all three cases.	yes

53	58dcbb8c8acda34529000021	Does the histone chaperone ASF1 interact with histones H1/H2?	The C terminus of the histone chaperone Asf1 cross-links to histone H3 in yeast and promotes interaction with histones H3 and H4. The central histone H3/H4 chaperone Asf1 comprises a highly conserved globular core and a divergent C-terminal tail.  The histone H3-H4 chaperone Asf1 is involved in chromatin assembly (or disassembly), histone exchange, regulation of transcription, and chromatin silencing in several organisms.  An ASF1-EGFP fusion protein localizes to the nucleus. By tandem-affinity purification/mass spectrometry as well as yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified histones H3 and H4 as ASF1 interaction partners.   This inhibition requires Asf1 binding to H3-H4 and Rtt109 KAT activity, but not tail acetylation of H3-H4 or K56 acetylation of H3.  Asf1 is a conserved histone H3/H4 chaperone that can assemble and disassemble nucleosomes and promote histone acetylation.  Here we characterize further interactions between budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) Asf1 and Set2 using assays of intragenic transcription, H3/H4 posttranslational modification, coding region cross-linking of Asf1 and Set2, and cooccurrence of Asf1 and Set2 in protein complexes.  Consistent with this possibility, we show that Asf1 stimulates Set2 occupancy of the coding region of a highly transcribed gene by a mechanism that depends on Asf1 binding to H3/H4.  Drosophila histones H3 and H4 can also be produced as a soluble (H3H4)(2) heterotetrameric complex if they are co-expressed with the histone chaperone Asf1. Structure and function of the histone chaperone CIA/ASF1 complexed with histones H3 and H4. Newly synthesized histones H3-H4 first bind histone chaperone Asf1 and are then transferred to other chaperones for nucleosome assembly The C terminus of the histone chaperone Asf1 cross-links to histone H3 in yeast and promotes interaction with histones H3 and H4 Histone chaperone Asf1 is required for histone H3 lysine 56 acetylation, a modification associated with S phase in mitosis and meiosis Antisilencing function 1 (ASF1) is a major histone H3-H4 chaperone that deposits histones H3 and H4 onto DNA Rtt109, a recently discovered histone acetyltransferase (HAT) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, functions with the histone chaperone Asf1 to acetylate lysine K56 on histone H3 (H3K56), a modification associated with newly synthesized histones In this issue of Cell, English et al. present the first crystal structure of a histone chaperone (Asf1) bound to histones (the H3/H4 heterodimer) By tandem-affinity purification/mass spectrometry as well as yeast two-hybrid analysis, we identified histones H3 and H4 as ASF1 interaction partners. Anti-silencing function 1 (Asf1) is a highly conserved chaperone of histones H3/H4 that assembles or disassembles chromatin during transcription, replication, and repair. Analysis of a panel of Asf1 mutations that modulate the ability of Asf1 to bind to histones H3/H4 demonstrates that the histone binding activity of Asf1 is required for the acetylation of Lys-9 and Lys-56 on newly synthesized H3. Thus Rad53 competes with histones H3-H4 and cochaperones HirA/CAF-I for binding to Asf1. Structure and function of the histone chaperone CIA/ASF1 complexed with histones H3 and H4. Currently, the best-characterized chaperone-histone interaction is that between the ubiquitous chaperone Asf1 and a dimer of H3 and H4.	no
58	5a7a44b4faa1ab7d2e000010	Is Loss of function one of the cardinal signs of inflammation?	The concept of the four cardinal signs of acute inflammation comes from antiquity as rubor et tumor cum calore et dolore, (redness and swelling with heat and pain) extended later by functio laesa (loss of function). As early as 2000 years ago, the Roman encyclopaedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus recognised four cardinal signs of this response-redness, heat, swelling and pain; a fifth sign is loss of function.[... It was Galen who added the disturbance of function (functio laesa) as the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well-known cardinal signs of Celsus (rubor, calor, tumor, dolor). Tumor, calor, rubor, and dolor describe four cardinal signs of inflammation. The fifth-functio laesa, or loss of function-was promulgated by Rudolf Virchow, who, in the 19th century, also noted an intricate link between inflammation and cancer. 	yes
