3	52bf1db603868f1b06000011	Has Denosumab (Prolia) been approved by FDA?	Denosumab is a RANK-ligand antibody that was approved by the FDA in 2010 for the prevention of skeletal fractures in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.  The authors present the imaging findings and technical report of an attempted percutaneous vertebroplasty in the only patient found to be actively under treatment with denosumab after a retrospective review of the databank of patients with pathological fractures referred to the Department Radiology of the Ohio State University for percutaneous vertebroplasty (a total sample of 20 patients) since the FDA approval of denosumab (November 2010) until June of 2013 (a 30-month period). On the basis of this data, the FDA approved denosumab for the treatment of patients whose GCTB is unresectable, or when surgery is likely to result in severe morbidity. Denosumab (Prolia®) is a fully human monoclonal antibody for RANKL, which selectively inhibits osteoclastogenesis, being recently approved for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women at a high or increased risk of fracture by the FDA in the United Sates and by the European Medicines Agency in Europe since June 2010. Recent phase II clinical trials with denosumab in skeletally mature adolescents over age 12 years and adults with GCTB, have shown both safety and efficacy, leading to its accelerated US FDA approval on 13 June 2013.  Zoledronic acid (ZA), an intravenously administered bisphosphonate, and Denosumab, a subcutaneously administered inhibitor of nuclear factor B ligand (RANKL), have already been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for their use in treatment of bone metastases. These results led to the approval of denosumab by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for the prevention of SREs in adults with bone metastases from solid tumors, including breast cancer. Alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, denosumab, and teriparatide are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic options.  Several of these therapies have recently been approved by the FDA to treat bone cancer pain (bisphosphonates, denosumab) and others are currently being evaluated in human clinical trials (tanezumab). A fourth agent, denosumab (bone targeted therapy) was also recently approved by the FDA for patients with bone metastasis after showing a reduction in the occurrence of skeletal-related events.  AHRQ published an updated review in March 2012 that summarized the benefits and risks of osteoporosis medications in treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, including bisphosphonates (aledronate, risedronate, ibandronate, zoledronic acid), parathyroid hormone, teriparatide, calcitonin, estrogens (for prevention in postmenopausal women), selective estrogen receptor modulators (raloxifene), and denosumab(approved by the FDA in 2010).  Four new drugs have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approval in 2010 and 2011: sipuleucel-T, an immunotherapeutic agent; cabazitaxel, a novel microtubule inhibitor; abiraterone acetate, a new androgen biosynthesis inhibitor; and denosumab, a bone-targeting agent.  Recently, the US FDA and the EMA approved denosumab (a fully human monoclonal antibody) to treat skeletal-related events in bone-metastatic prostate cancer. In addition to these new and emerging therapeutic agents, denosumab was approved for the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases due to solid tumor malignancies, providing an alternative to zoledronic acid.  Recently, denosumab was FDA-approved for prevention of SREs in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors.  In the 2010s to date, an additional 3 antibodies (denosumab, belimumab, ipilimumab) have been approved and one antibody-drug conjugate (brentuximab vedotin) is undergoing regulatory review and may be approved in the US by August 30, 2011. We also review the evidence supporting the FDA's approval of denosumab (bone-targeted therapy) as a treatment option for men with CRPC and bony metastases.   It has been approved for clinical use by the FDA in the US and by the European Medicines Agency in Europe since June 2010 (trade name Prolia(™), Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA, USA).  The fully human monoclonal antibody denosumab (Prolia(®)) has been recently approved by the European Medical Agency (EMEA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.  Raloxifene and denosumab are only FDA approved for postmenopausal osteoporosis. The new antiresorptive drug, denosumab, although FDA-approved only for postmenopausal women, has been shown in a study of men on ADT to increase bone density in spine, hip, and forearm and decrease vertebral fractures on x-ray.   Since then, an additional six human mAbs have received FDA approval: panitumumab, golimumab, canakinumab, ustekinumab, ofatumumab and denosumab. 	yes
13	552fa6f5bc4f83e828000002	Is peripheral neuroepithelioma related to Ewing sarcoma?	"The term ""small round-cell tumor"" describes a group of highly aggressive malignant tumors composed of relatively small and monotonous undifferentiated cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios. This group includes Ewing's sarcoma (ES), peripheral neuroepithelioma (aka, primitive neuroectodermal tumor or extraskeletal ES), peripheral neuroblastoma (""classic-type""), rhabdomyosarcoma, desmoplastic small round-cell tumor, lymphoma, leukemia, small-cell osteosarcoma, small-cell carcinoma (either undifferentiated or neuroendocrine), olfactory neuroblastoma, cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma (aka, Merkel-cell carcinoma), small-cell melanoma, and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. Their clinical presentations often overlap, thus making a definitive diagnosis problematic in some cases AIMS: To retrospectively study the DNA content in a series of childhood Ewing Family Tumors (EFT), and to investigate its prognostic value. METHODS: The study was performed on a series of 27 EFTs (osseous Ewing's sarcoma, 18 cases; extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma, 2; peripheral neuroepithelioma, 4; Askin Rosai tumors, 3 To improve the prognosis of patients with poor-risk peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (pPNETs; including peripheral neuroepithelioma and Ewing's sarcoma) Large group of small-round-cell tumours of soft tissues and bone represents a complex diagnostic problem for the pathologists. Neuronal nature of many tumours from this group is proven by means of new methods--immunophenotypic analysis, tissue culture, cytogenetics. Peripheral neuroepithelioma, Ewing tumour, primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET), Askin tumour belong to these neoplasms Comparison of Ewing's sarcoma of bone and peripheral neuroepithelioma. An immunocytochemical and ultrastructural analysis of two primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms Ewing's sarcoma of bone (ESB) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are frequently considered to be different tumors. Some researchers have suggested that PN is morphologically a neuroectodermal Ewing's sarcoma. We sought to determine the extent of neuroectodermal features in conventional ESB on direct patient material (25 cases) and to compare these tumors with a similar group of readily diagnosed PNs (10 cases) Neuroectodermal antigens (neuron-specific enolase, Leu-7 [HNK-1], neurofilament 200 kd, and S100) were found in nine of 10 cases of PN and in 17 of 25 cases of ESB These data support the concept that ESB and PN are both peripheral primitive neuroectodermal neoplasms, differing only in extent of neuroectodermal phenotype and morphological differentiation Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin. Ewings sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are closely related tumors, and it can be difficult to distinguish them from other small-round-cell tumors (SRCTs). The presence of this translocation in Ewing sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor has been taken as evidence that these two tumors are related. Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin. Indistinguishable patterns of protooncogene expression in two distinct but closely related tumors: Ewing's sarcoma and neuroepithelioma. Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are related tumors, possibly of neural crest origin, which are cytogenetically characterized by the specific translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12). Ewing's sarcoma/peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (ES/pPNET) are a group of small round cell sarcomas that show varying degrees of neuroectodermal differentiation characterized by translocation involving the EWS gene Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are closely related tumors, and it can be difficult to distinguish them from other small-round-cell tumors (SRCTs) Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral neuroepithelioma (PN) are related tumors, possibly of neural crest origin, which are cytogenetically characterized by the specific translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) This genetical similarity further supports a nosological concept according to which Askin's tumour, Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma represent phenotypic variations of the same tumour, namely the peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour. Besides these antigenic features, Ewing sarcoma cells are characterized by a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation also observed in neuroepithelioma, a neuroectodermal tumor, suggesting a possible evolutionary related origin"	yes
24	52b2ec744003448f55000001	Can Levoxyl (levothyroxine sodium) cause insomnia?	METHODS: Seventy-one patients diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism were randomly allocated into two study groups: the first group received usual dose of levothyroxine and the second group received combination of levothyroxine and liothyronine for at least 4 months. The main outcomes were psychosocial problems (Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire, GHQ-28), bodyweight, heart rate, blood pressure, and serum lipid levels. RESULTS: In both groups serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels remained unchanged compared with baseline. Psychosocial scores, body weight, heart rate, blood pressure, and lipid profile in the two groups remained constant. The only exception was a small but significant reduction in anxiety/insomnia in combined treatment group as compared with monotherapy. 	yes
26	5344310baeec6fbd0700000c	Does the CTCF protein co-localize with cohesin?	To investigate cohesin-non-CTCF (CNC) binding events in vivo we mapped cohesin and CTCF, as well as a collection of tissue-specific and ubiquitous transcriptional regulators using ChIP-seq in primary mouse liver. In contrast to regions of the genome where cohesin and CTCF colocalize, CNC sites coincide with the binding of master regulators and enhancer-markers and are significantly associated with liver-specific expressed genes. Here we report that cohesins colocalize with CTCF at two additional imprinted loci, the Dlk1-Dio3 and the Kcnq1/Kcnq1ot1 loci. By use of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2), we found that liver-specific transcription factors colocalize with cohesin independently of CTCF at liver-specific targets that are distinct from those found in breast cancer cells Because cohesin can colocalize with CTCF, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation for the cohesin subunit Rad21 and found lineage and stage-specific Rad21 recruitment to CTCF in all Ig loci Here we show that zebrafish runx1 is directly bound by cohesin and CCCTC binding factor (CTCF) at the P1 and P2 promoters, and within the intron between P1 and P2. The intronic binding sites for cohesin and CTCF coincide with histone modifications that confer enhancer-like properties, and two of the cohesin/CTCF sites behaved as insulators in an in vivo assay The identified cohesin and CTCF binding sites are likely to be cis-regulatory elements (CREs) for runx1 since they also recruit RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). We have found that CTCF and cohesin are highly enriched at the convergent and partially overlapping transcripts for the LMP1 and LMP2A genes, but it is not yet known how CTCF and cohesin may coordinately regulate these transcripts haracterization of constitutive CTCF/cohesin loci: a possible role in establishing topological domains in mammalian genomes Our analysis revealed: 1) constitutive CTCF loci were located in constitutive open chromatin and often co-localized with constitutive cohesin loci In brain, a third of CTCF and cohesin binding sites coincide, consistent with the potential for many interactions between cohesin and CTCF but also many instances of independent action Here, we focus on the emerging roles of CTCF and the cohesin in coordinating long-range interactions between regulatory elements Chromatin immunoprecipitation for CTCF and the cohesin subunits RAD21 and SMC3 reveals evolutionarily conserved binding sites within unmethylated regions ∼5 kb downstream of the PLAGL1 differentially methylated region and within the PLAGL1 3' untranslated region (UTR) TCF physically links cohesin to chromatin ohesin and CTCF: cooperating to control chromosome conformation? Recently, three groups mapped numerous cohesin-binding sites in mammalian chromosomes and found substantial overlap with the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) We found that each site contains a conserved CTCF consensus sequence, binds CTCF, and recruits the cohesin subunit Rad21 in vivo Recent experiments have revealed that cohesin binds to the same sites in mammalian genomes as the zinc finger transcription factor CTCF Here we review what is known about the roles of cohesin and CTCF in regulating gene expression in mammalian cells, and we discuss how cohesin might mediate the insulator function of CTCF Previous studies have shown that this major latency control region is occupied by the cellular chromatin boundary factor CTCF and chromosome structural maintenance proteins SMC1, SMC3, and RAD21, which comprise the cohesin complex Cohesin subunits assembled at the CTCF binding sites and bound CTCF proteins in a cell cycle-dependent manner We propose that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle control of viral gene expression during latency and that failure to maintain cell cycle control of latent transcripts inhibits host cell proliferation and survival We used chromosome conformation capture to determine long-range interactions among CTCF/cohesin sites over 2 Mb on human chromosome 11 encompassing the beta-globin locus and flanking olfactory receptor genes These results support a genome-wide role for CTCF/cohesin sites through loop formation that both influences transcription and contributes to cell-type-specific chromatin organization and function Increased methylation at this promoter triggered the dissociation of the insulator protein CTCF as well as the accompanying cohesin from the BDNF locus icotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)-regulated DNA methylation alters CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)/cohesin binding and transcription at the BDNF locus ecent studies have shown that the protein CTCF, which plays an important role in insulation and in large-scale organization of chromatin within the eukaryotic nucleus, depends for both activities on recruitment of the cohesin complex We show here that the interaction of CTCF with the cohesin complex involves direct contacts between the cohesin subunit SA2 and specific regions of the C-terminal tail of CTCF Taken together, our results demonstrate that specific sites on the C terminus of CTCF are essential for cohesin binding and insulator function The only direct interaction between CTCF and cohesin involves contact with SA2, which is external to the cohesin ring These numerous CTCF/cohesin sites potentially form the bases of the multiloop rosette structures at the Igh locus that compact during Ig heavy chain rearrangement We have previously shown that the Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) major latency transcripts encoding LANA, vCyclin, vFLIP, v-miRNAs, and Kaposin are regulated, in part, by a chromatin organizing element that binds CTCF and cohesins Mutation of the CTCF-cohesin binding site reduced or eliminated the chromatin conformation linkages, and deregulated viral transcription and genome copy number control Our findings indicate that KSHV genomes are organized into chromatin loops mediated by CTCF and cohesin interactions, and that these inter-chromosomal linkages coordinate latent and lytic gene control. We show here that GA disrupts an RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) complex that accumulates at the CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron of the latency transcript. GA altered the enrichment of the RNAPII pausing complex, along with pausing factors SPT5 and NELF-A, at the intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites. GA treatment also inhibited the transcription of some cellular genes, like c-myc, which contain a similar CTCF-cohesin binding site within the first intron. These findings suggest that RNAPII pauses at intragenic CTCF-cohesin binding sites and that abrogation of this pausing by GA leads to loss of proper mRNA production and defects in sister chromatid cohesion, a process important for both viral and cellular chromosome stability. TCF and cohesin cooperatively mediate the cell-type specific interchromatin interaction between Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci Additional experiments verified that the interchromatin interaction between the Bcl11b and Arhgap6 loci was cell-type specific, which was cooperatively mediated by CTCF and cohesin. enome-wide studies of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin provide insight into chromatin structure and regulation Recent genome-wide studies mapping the binding sites of CTCF and its interacting partner, cohesin, using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealded that CTCF globally co-localizes with cohesin Here, we show by ChIP-Seq that most human subtelomeres contain a CTCF- and cohesin-binding site within ∼1-2 kb of the TTAGGG repeat tract and adjacent to a CpG-islands implicated in TERRA transcription control. These findings indicate that CTCF and cohesin are integral components of most human subtelomeres, and important for the regulation of TERRA transcription and telomere end protection In addition, we show that this DNA looping requires specific binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex to two symmetrically aligned binding sites in both the transcriptionally active promoters and in one of the enhancers	yes
57	530cf57efe2466f70c000001	Has depression been shown to be a predictor of frailty?	"significant role of frailty as a predictor of depression in a relatively younger old Chinese population significant relationships between frailty and depressive symptoms and mortality at 1 year These findings suggest that malnutrition is a major predictor of frailty or the ""failure to thrive"" syndrome in older persons. Depression is a major cause of poor nutritional status in older persons. Depressed mood was associated with increased risk of steep strength decline, in particular in older men with low body weight. Low body weight in combination with depressed mood may be an indicator of frailty or severe disease status that leads to accelerated strength loss and disability. Longitudinally, depressed mood was the only independent predictor of decline in cognition, functional ability, physician-rated health, and mortality;"	yes
66	52f88a972059c6d71c000033	Can life style changes reduce oxidative stress	The CFS group had an unfavorable lipid profile and signs of oxidative stress induced damage to lipids and proteins. These results might be indicative of early proatherogenic processes in this group of patients who are otherwise at low risk for atherosclerosis. Antioxidant treatment and life style changes are indicated for women with CFS, as well as closer observation in order to assess the degree of atherosclerosis. Once detected, these patients may be offered more aggressive treatment strategies such as early pharmacotherapy in addition to life style changes targeted to maintaining pericyte integrity. Our results suggested that life style changes which related to migration might reduce DNA damage in Hasake nationalities. Low levels of antioxidants and increased oxidative stress with insulin resistance in metabolic syndrome suggests that besides therapeutic life style changes (TLC) as suggested in ATP III guidelines inclusion of antioxidant vitamins, fruits and vegetable could be beneficial to ward off the consequences of metabolic syndrome.	yes
68	56b39f148525abca1e000004	Is the Dictyostelium discoideum proteome known?	The Negative Proteome Database (NPD) is populated with pair-wise protein sequence comparisons between each of the following proteomes: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Dictyostelium discoideum, Chlamydomonus reinhardti, Escherichia coli K12, Arabidopsis thaliana and Methanoscarcina acetivorans. The Dictyostelium discoideum proteome--the SWISS-2DPAGE database of the multicellular aggregate (slug). Consequently, this genomic sequence information can now be exploited to realize D. discoideum proteomics projects.  The Dictyostelium discoideum genome has been sequenced, assembled and annotated to a high degree of reliability. The parts-list of proteins and RNA encoded by the six chromosomes can now be accessed and analyzed.  The 34 Mb genome of Dictyostelium discoideum is carried on 6 chromosomes and has been fully sequenced by an international consortium. The sequence was assembled on the classical and physical maps that had been built up over the years and refined by HAPPY mapping. Annotation of the sequence predicted about 12,000 genes for proteins of at least 50 amino acids in length. In this study, a quantitative comparative proteomics approach has been used to analyze the Dictyostelium discoideum mitochondrial proteome variations during vegetative growth, starvation and the early stages of development.  The secreted proteome profile of developing Dictyostelium discoideum cells. The present repertoire validates our purification method and paves the way for a future proteomics approach to study the dynamics of macropinocytosis.

71	52fc94572059c6d71c000070	Is apixaban effective for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism?	Apixaban is a direct inhibitor of factor Xa, and is a potential alternative for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism.  These results suggest a lack of clear superiority of apixaban relative to enoxaparin. Apixaban is an oral alternative with similar efficacy and safety to existing anticoagulant therapies. A fixed-dose regimen of apixaban alone was noninferior to conventional therapy for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism and was associated with significantly less bleeding To critically review the effectiveness of the novel oral anticoagulants (rivaroxaban, dabigatran, ximelagatran, and apixaban) in the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism. ompared with vitamin K antagonists, the novel oral anticoagulants had a similar risk of recurrence of acute venous thromboembolism and all cause mortality, though rivaroxaban was associated with a reduced risk of bleeding Nowadays, the new anticoagulants, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban, show potential advantages over classical treatments. These agents inhibit specific coagulation factors and are administered orally at fixed doses. In a recently completed phase III trial, apixaban also demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in that indication the most advanced oral direct inhibitors to factor Xa (rivaroxaban and apixaban) and IIa (dabigatran)	yes
81	5549f7a1f35db7552600000d	Can a given genotype exhibit opposite fitness effects (beneficial and detrimental) within the same environment?	Mutations beneficial in one environment may cause costs in different environments, resulting in antagonistic pleiotropy. Here, we describe a novel form of antagonistic pleiotropy that operates even within the same environment, where benefits and deleterious effects exhibit themselves at different growth rates. The hfq mutations were beneficial, deleterious or neutral at an intermediate growth rate (0.5 h(-1)) and one changed from beneficial to deleterious within a 36 min difference in doubling time. Two genetic models exist to explain the evolution of ageing - mutation accumulation (MA) and antagonistic pleiotropy (AP). Under AP, late-acting deleterious mutations accumulate because they confer beneficial effects early in life. Many marker loci responded in opposite directions to selection for late- and early-life fitness, indicating negative genetic correlations or trade-offs between those traits. Indirect evidence suggested that some negative genetic correlations were due to antagonistic pleiotropy. Here, we describe a novel form of antagonistic pleiotropy that operates even within the same environment, where benefits and deleterious effects exhibit themselves at different growth rates. The basis of antagonistic pleiotropy in hfq mutations that have opposite effects on fitness at slow and fast growth rates. Here, we describe a novel form of antagonistic pleiotropy that operates even within the same environment, where benefits and deleterious effects exhibit themselves at different growth rates	yes
86	513f4025bee46bd34c000011	Is microRNA(miRNA) 29 involved in post-ischemic cardiac remodeling?	Myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced remodelling generally includes cell death (necrosis and apoptosis), myocyte hypertrophy, angiogenesis, cardiac fibrosis, and myocardial dysfunction. I In addition, miR-21, -24, -133, -210, -494, and -499 appear to protect myocytes against I/R-induced apoptosis, whereas miR-1, -29, -199a, and -320 promote apoptosis Myocardial fibrosis can be regulated by the miR-29 family Studies using various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models have suggested the possible involvement of miR-1, miR-21, miR-29, miR-92a, miR-133, miR-199a, and miR-320 in ischemia-reperfusion injury and/or remodeling after myocardial infarction. Among the MI-regulated miRNAs are members of the miR-29 family, which are down-regulated in the region of the heart adjacent to the infarct. The miR-29 family targets a cadre of mRNAs that encode proteins involved in fibrosis, including multiple collagens, fibrillins, and elastin. Thus, down-regulation of miR-29 would be predicted to derepress the expression of these mRNAs and enhance the fibrotic response. Indeed, down-regulation of miR-29 with anti-miRs in vitro and in vivo induces the expression of collagens, whereas over-expression of miR-29 in fibroblasts reduces collagen expression. We conclude that miR-29 acts as a regulator of cardiac fibrosis and represents a potential therapeutic target for tissue fibrosis in general.	yes
95	56e19eba51531f7e33000012	Is the yeast Μac1 transcription factor induced upon copper deficiency?	Low-affinity copper transporter CTR2 is regulated by copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The copper-depletion induced CTR2 transcription can be abrogated by genetic deletion of copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p Taken together, our results suggest that Mac1p can activate the expression of vacuolar copper transporter Ctr2p in response to copper deficiency, resulting in yeast resistance to copper starvation. The ablation of either MAC1 or AFT1 also abrogated CTR2 expression induced by copper depletion Our further study revealed that exogenous Aft1p upregulates CTR2 transcription only in the presence of Mac1p, whereas exogenous Mac1p upregulates CTR2 transcription only in the presence of Aft1p. We previously reported that CTR2 can be upregulated by copper deficiency via copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcriptional responses to copper deficiency are mediated by the copper-responsive transcription factor Mac1 Although Mac1 activates the transcription of genes involved in high affinity copper uptake during periods of deficiency, little is known about the mechanisms by which Mac1 senses or responds to reduced copper availability.  The catalytic activity of Sod1 is essential for Mac1 activation and promotes a regulated increase in binding of Mac1 to copper response elements in the promoter regions of genomic Mac1 target genes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, copper ions regulate gene expression through the two transcriptional activators, Ace1 and Mac1. Ace1 mediates copper-induced gene expression in cells exposed to stressful levels of copper salts, whereas Mac1 activates a subset of genes under copper-deficient conditions. Taken together, our results suggest that Mac1p can activate the expression of vacuolar copper transporter Ctr2p in response to copper deficiency, resulting in yeast resistance to copper starvation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcriptional responses to copper deficiency are mediated by the copper-responsive transcription factor Mac1. We previously reported that CTR2 can be upregulated by copper deficiency via copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p. The yeast Mac1 protein is a copper-sensing transcription factor that is essential for both the activation and inactivation of genes required for high affinity copper ion transport. The copper-depletion induced CTR2 transcription can be abrogated by genetic deletion of copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p.  Copper-mediated repression of the activation domain in the yeast Mac1p transcription factor. We previously reported that CTR2 can be upregulated by copper deficiency via copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p.  In this study, we found that copper depletion can upregulate yeast CTR2 gene transcription while copper overload downregulate it. The copper-depletion induced CTR2 transcription can be abrogated by genetic deletion of copper-sensing transcription factor Mac1p.	yes
97	530cefaaad0bf1360c000001	Is alemtuzumab effective for remission induction in patients diagnosed with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia?	Sequential chemoimmunotherapy of fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide induction followed by alemtuzumab consolidation is effective in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia A central need in this historically refractory tumor is the controlled evaluation of multiagent chemotherapy and its combination with the currently most active single agent, alemtuzumab.  FMC-A is a safe and efficient protocol in T-PLL, which compares favorably to published data. Currently, the best treatment for T-PLL is IV alemtuzumab, which has resulted in very high response rates of more than 90% when given as frontline treatment and a significant improvement in survival.  The patient failed to respond to standard ALL induction chemotherapy, but achieved complete remission following treatment with a fludarabine and alemtuzumab-based regimen. Here we present a rare case of concurrent T-PLL and Kaposi sarcoma who achieved a complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission after a very short course of treatment with alemtuzumab.  Recent studies with single-agent alemtuzumab, an anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, have shown improved response rates and survival in patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.  The CD52 antigen is expressed at high density on the malignant T-cells and therapy with alemtuzumab, a humanized IgG1 antibody that targets this antigen, has produced promising results.  With the introduction of alemtuzumab, most patients who progressed despite treatment with pentostatin had a major response with a complete remission rate higher than that obtained with pentostatin when used as a first line. Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52, Campath-1H) has recently been shown to be effective in the treatment of a range of hematological malignancies, including B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. Here we report the outcome of two patients with CD4-positive T cell prolymphocytic leukemia treated with CAMPATH-1H. Both patients responded rapidly to treatment and subsequently developed CD4 lymphopenia. T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a chemotherapy-resistant malignancy with a median survival of 7.5 months. Preliminary results indicated a high remission induction rate with the human CD52 antibody, CAMPATH-1H.  CAMPATH-1H (30 mg) was administered intravenously 3 times weekly until maximal response. The overall response rate was 76% with 60% CR and 16% partial remission (PR). These responses were durable with a median disease-free interval of 7 months (range, 4-45 months).  The conclusion is that CAMPATH-1H is an effective therapy in T-PLL, producing remissions in more than two thirds of patients.  For example, most patients with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, including those with large tumor burdens and high peripheral white blood cell counts, will enter complete remission using the antibody CAMPATH-1H without any evidence of tumor lysis. Overall response rate to FMC was 68%, comprising 6 complete remissions (all bone-marrow confirmed) and 11 partial remissions. Alemtuzumab consolidation increased the intent-to-treat overall response rate to 92% (12 complete remissions; 11 partial remissions). 	yes
100	55031963e9bde6963400002a	Is desmin an intermediate filament protein involved in Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)?	Desmin-related myofibrillar myopathy (DRM) is a cardiac and skeletal muscle disease caused by mutations in the desmin (DES) gene. Mutations in the central 2B domain of DES cause skeletal muscle disease that typically precedes cardiac involvement. However, the prevalence of DES mutations in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) without skeletal muscle disease is not known. The lack of severe disruption of cytoskeletal desmin network formation seen with mutations in the 1A and tail domains suggests that dysfunction of seemingly intact desmin networks is sufficient to cause DCM. According to the predominant view, desmin mutations cause dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We evaluated a family with restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) associated with a novel desmin mutation and reviewed recent reports regarding the frequency of RCM in patients with desmin myopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by enlargement and dilation of all heart compartments associated with serious decrease of its contractile function. DCM hallmark is the combination of dystrophic and hypertrophic alterations of cardiomyocytes. Since the power output of cardiac cells is directly related to remodeling of their contractile machinery we investigated expression of selected contractile and cytoskeletal proteins in the left ventricle of DCM patients using immunoblotting. The content of the recognized protein markers of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy such as tubulin, desmin and slow skeletal myosin heavy chain isoform, MHCbeta, was significantly elevated in DCM compared to normal myocardium. In contrast, overexpression of desmin filaments by itself is not detrimental to the heart. Although loss-of-function studies have been more limited, ablation of the desmin gene causes mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, resulting in cardiomyopathy in mice. From function studies, abnormal desmin aggregation and disruption of the desmin networks resulting from expression of either mutant desmin or mutant CryAB have been shown to remodel the heart and compromise cardiac function, suggesting their synergistic roles in disease pathogenesis. A missense mutation in the desmin gene (DES) causes DCM in a human family. Mice deficient in desmin, the muscle-specific member of the intermediate filament gene family, display defects in all muscle types and particularly in the myocardium. Desmin null hearts develop cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) characterized by extensive myocyte cell death, calcific fibrosis and multiple ultrastructural defects. Several lines of evidence suggest impaired vascular function in desmin null animals. Familial DCM is commonly inherited as autosomal dominant trait; less frequently it is autosomal recessive, X-linked or matrilinear. The disease is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Genes causally linked to this phenotype include dystrophin, dystrophin-associated glycoproteins, actin, desmin, beta-miosin heavy chain, cardiac troponin T, and mitochondrial DNA genes, mostly transfer RNAs. Examination of families has identified so far eight disease genes, namely the dystrophin, tafazzin, cardiac actin, desmin, lamin A/C, delta- sarcoglycan, cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain, and cardiac troponin T gene. Mutations of the desmin,   delta-sarcoglycan, the cardiac actin and beta-myosin heavy chain as well as the troponin T gene are known to cause autosomal dominant-dilated cardiomyopathy without other abnormalities. Autosomal dominant DCM is the most frequent form (56% of our cases), and several candidate disease loci have been identified by linkage analysis. Three disease genes are presently known: the cardiac actin gene, the desmin gene, and the lamin A/C gene. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Two genes have been identified for the X-linked forms (dystrophin and tafazzin), whereas three other genes (actin, lamin A/C, and desmin) cause autosomal dominant DCM; Desmin defects were also recently identified in 1 familial dilated cardiomyopathy. By candidate gene screening, the molecular diagnosis can be provided for dystrophin, DAG, mitochondrial DNA, actin and desmin gene defects. Desmin (z-bands) are partly destroyed in DCM. Anti-desmin antibody titers as indicators of a possible secondary immune response are found high in patients with acute myocarditis declining during reconvalescence and are also elevated in DCM.  Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament protein, is a major target in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure in humans and mice Desmin, the muscle-specific intermediate filament, is involved in myofibrillar myopathies, dilated cardiomyopathy and muscle wasting	yes

Two botulism outbreaks were attributed to commercial ready-to-eat meat products and 3 to foods served in restaurants; several cases were attributed to non-Native home-prepared foods. Three affected pregnant women delivered healthy infants. Botulinum toxin is not expected to be present in systemic circulation following proper intramuscular or intradermal injection. Moreover, BTX-A, which has a high molecular weight, does not appear to cross the placenta. From the 38 pregnancies reported in the literature, including women who had botulism poisoning during pregnancy, exposure to BTX-A does not appear to increase the risk of adverse outcome in the fetus.

147	56e83a2342442bac75000001	Are integrins part of the extracellular matrix?	Several constituents of the ECM provide adhesive cues, which serve as binding sites for cell trans-membrane receptors, such as integrins. We also determined that blocking β1integrins, the major class of receptors for all ECM proteins tested, Here, we elucidate a cross-scale mechanism for tissue assembly and ECM remodeling involving Cadherin 2, the ECM protein Fibronectin, and its receptor Integrin α5.  due to the diverse functions and variable expression of proteoglycans, matrix proteins, and integrins, it is rather difficult to identify a comprehensive therapeutic target among ECM components. Integrin-dependent cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion is a determinant of spindle orientation. The extracellular matrix component periostin is a secreted protein that functions as both a cell attachment protein and an autocrine or paracrine factor that signals through the cell adhesion molecule integrins αvβ3 and αvβ5.  Integrin receptors connect the extracellular matrix to the cell cytoskeleton to provide essential forces and signals.   the integrin, talin, and actin filament form a linear complex of which both ends are typically anchored to the extracellular matrices via integrins. Integrins, a central family of cellular ECM receptors, have been implicated in these processes but their specific role in ES cell self-renewal remains unclear. Attachment to the extracellular matrix is mediated by a complex of adhesion proteins, including integrins, signaling molecules, actin and actin-binding proteins, and scaffolding proteins. Beta 1 integrin binding plays a role in the constant traction force generation in response to varying stiffness for cells grown on mature cardiac extracellular matrix.	yes
156	513efe01bee46bd34c00000e	Is paramyxovirus involved in human subacute thyroiditis?	Most cases of subacute thyroiditis are caused by a variety of viruses, for example, Coxsackie, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and adenovirus. Influenza immunization or infection may cause subacute thyroiditis. Coxsackie virus has been reported to be one of the viruses associated with the disease. The etiology of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (SAT) is obscure, although it is postulated to be associated with viral infections and genetic factors. The results suggest that SAT is not usually associated with acute infections No evidence was obtained to support the proposed role of enteroviruses as an important etiologic agent of SAT. The viral antibodies evaluated were those of Influenza A and B, Coxsackie A9, B1, B2, B3, B4, B5 and B6, Echo 3, 7, 11 and 12, Parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4, and Adeno 8 virus. The following results were obtained: In class I HLA typing, the frequency of HLA-Bw35 in SAT was 67.4%, which was significantly (p less than 0.0001) higher than that in the control (14.1%). On the other hand, the frequency of Cw1 in SAT (14.6%) was significantly (p less than 0.01) lower than that of the control (32.1%), and that of Cw3 (65.2%) was significantly (p less than 0.01) higher than that of the control (46.5%).	no

Channelrhodospin-2 (ChR2), a light-sensitive ion channel, and its variants have emerged as new excitatory optogenetic tools not only in neuroscience, but also in other areas, including cardiac electrophysiology.

190	55016397e9bde69634000006	Is Sarcolipin a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Calcium ATPase SERCA?	The activity of SERCA is regulated by two small, homologous membrane proteins called phospholamban (PLB, also known as PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Detailed structural information explaining this regulatory mechanism has been lacking, and the structural features defining the pathway through which cytoplasmic Ca(2+) enters the intramembranous binding sites of SERCA have remained unknown. Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)ATPase (SERCA) pump activity is modulated by phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac and skeletal muscle. Recent data suggest that SLN could play a role in muscle thermogenesis by promoting uncoupling of the SERCA pump Here we show that sarcolipin (Sln), a newly identified regulator of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (Serca) pump, is necessary for muscle-based thermogenesis. Sarcolipin (SLN) is a 3 kD membrane protein found in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). It has 31 amino acid residues; SLN and phopholamban (PLB) are belong to the same protein family, so they have similar physiological functions. SLN inhibits sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) activity and reduces its affinity of Ca(2+), resulting in dysfunction of myocardial contraction and heart failure. Sarcolipin (SLN) is a key regulator of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and its expression is altered in diseased atrial myocardium. Together, these findings indicate that ablation of SLN results in increased SERCA activity and SR Ca(2+) load, which, in turn, could cause abnormal intracellular Ca(2+) handling and atrial remodeling. Sarcolipin (SLN) inhibits sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) pumps. These results show that 1) SLN regulates Ca(2+)-ATPase activity thereby regulating contractile kinetics in at least some skeletal muscles, 2) the functional significance of SLN is graded to the endogenous SLN expression level, and 3) SLN inhibitory effects on SERCA function are relieved in response to repeated contractions thus enhancing relaxation rates. The SERCA pump was constitutively activated in both atrial and ventricular chambers of the mouse heart by ablating its key regulators, phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). The double-knockout (dKO) mice for PLN and SLN showed increased SERCA pump activity, Ca(2+) transients and SR Ca(2+) load, and developed cardiac hypertrophy. Our findings also emphasize the need for dynamic regulation of the SERCA pump by PLN and/or SLN to maintain cardiac contractility in normal conditions and during pathophysiological states. Sarcolipin (SLN) has emerged as an important regulator of the atrial sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ transport. The inhibitory effect of SLN on cardiac SR Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) pump can be relieved by beta-adrenergic stimulation, which indicates that SLN is a reversible inhibitor.  Sarcolipin is a novel regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) and is expressed abundantly in atria. Our study documented that sarcolipin is a key regulator of SERCA2a in atria. Importantly, our data demonstrate the existence of distinct modulators for the SERCA pump in the atria and ventricles. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) is a membrane protein that catalyzes the ATP-dependent transport of Ca(2+) from the cytosol to the SR. The activity of SERCA is inhibited by phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN), and all these proteins participate in maintaining the normal intracellular calcium handling.  Sarcolipin (SLN) is an integral membrane protein that is expressed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, where it inhibits SERCA (calcium ATPase) by lowering its apparent Ca2+ affinity in a manner similar to that of its homologue phospholamban (PLN). Remarkably, each domain of SLN behaves in a manner similar to that of the corresponding domains in PLN, supporting the hypothesis that both SLN and PLN bind SERCA in the same groove and with similar mechanisms. The role of sarcolipin (SLN) in cardiac physiology was critically evaluated by generating a transgenic (TG) mouse model in which the SLN to sarco(endoplasmic)reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) ratio was increased in the ventricle. Overexpression of SLN decreases SR calcium transport function and results in decreased calcium transient amplitude and rate of relaxation. SLN TG hearts exhibit a significant decrease in rates of contraction and relaxation when assessed by ex vivo work-performing heart preparations. We conclude that SLN is a novel regulator of SERCA pump activity, and its inhibitory effect can be reversed by beta-adrenergic agonists. Sarcolipin, a homologue of phospholamban, regulates Ca2+ uptake through the interaction with sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA) and is predominantly expressed in the atrial muscle. Sarcolipin (SLN) and phospholamban (PLN) are effective inhibitors of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA).  These results show that NF-SLN expression impairs muscle contractile function by inhibiting SERCA function and diminishing sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores. Sarcolipin (SLN) is an inhibitor of sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPases (SERCAs) in vitro, but its function in vivo has not been defined. NF-SLN cDNA (SLN tagged N-terminally with a FLAG epitope) was introduced into rat soleus muscle in one hindlimb by plasmid injection and electrotransfer. Sarcolipin (SLN), a regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase of fast-twitch skeletal muscle (SERCA1a), is also expressed in cardiac and slow-twitch skeletal muscles where phospholamban (PLN) and SERCA2a are expressed. Sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) inhibition by sarcolipin is encoded in its luminal tail. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN). Phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) are two single-pass membrane proteins that regulate Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA), an ATP-driven pump that translocates calcium ions into the lumen of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, initiating muscle relaxation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner via interaction with the short integral membrane proteins phospholamban (PLN) and sarcolipin (SLN) [Research progress of sarcolipin-a new regulatory protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase].

Here we observe that mutation rate, as reflected in recent evolutionary divergence and human nucleotide diversity, is markedly increased in later-replicating regions of the human genome ll classes of substitutions are affected, suggesting a generalized mechanism involving replication time-dependent DNA damage We show that mutation rate varies 6-fold across a single chromosome, that this variation is correlated with replication timing, and we propose a model to explain this variation that relies on the temporal separation of two processes for replicating past damaged DNA: error-free DNA damage tolerance and translesion synthesis. Recent studies revealed a long suspected replication-timing effect on mutation rate, but the mechanisms that regulate the increase in mutation rate as the genome is replicated remain unclear.  DNA repair systems, in general, are less efficient in late replicating heterochromatic regions compared to early replicating euchromatic regions of the genome. The mutational profile of the yeast genome is shaped by replication the mutation rate increases with the replication timing by more than 30% between the earliest and the latest replicating regions. Thus, we show that the leading replicating strands present an excess of C over G and of A over T in the genome of S. cerevisiae (reciprocally an excess of G + T over C + A in lagging strands) Late-replicating domains have higher divergence and diversity in Drosophila melanogaster Recent evidence also suggests that late replication is associated with high mutability in yeast. Limited evidence from one chromosome arm in Drosophila melanogaster suggests the opposite pattern, with regions overlapping early-firing origins showing increased levels of diversity and divergence The mutation rate for DNA mismatch repair null strains was approximately 1 mutation per genome per generation, 225-fold greater than the wild-type rate. The mutations were distributed randomly throughout the genome, independent of replication timing. Many single-nucleotide substitutions in cancer genomes arise because of errors in DNA replication, which is spatio-temporally stratified. Here we propose that DNA replication patterns help shape the mutational landscapes of normal and cancer genomes Using data on five fully sequenced cancer types and two personal genomes, we determined that the frequency of intergenic single-nucleotide substitution is significantly higher in late DNA replication timing regions, even after controlling for a number of genomic features we found that genomic regions in close spatial proximity to late-replicating domains display similar mutation spectra as the late-replicating regions themselves In addition, certain chromosome rearrangements found in cancer cells and in cells exposed to ionizing radiation display a significant delay in replication timing of >3 hours that affects the entire chromosome(2,3). Recent work from our lab indicates that disruption of discrete cis-acting autosomal loci result in an extremely late replicating phenotype that affects the entire chromosome(4). A conservative estimate is that at least 1-2% of new deleterious mutations affect some aspect of DNA replication, repair, or chromosome segregation. Since deleterious mutations can have an effect even as heterozygotes, this mutation accumulation can create an inherited background of late-acting mutations that themselves enhance mutation rate. Drake calculates that lytic RNA viruses display spontaneous mutation rates of approximately one per genome while most have mutation rates that are approximately 0.1 per genome (Drake 1993). This constancy of germline mutation rates among microbial species need not necessarily mean constancy of the somatic mutation rates. A recent flurry of reports correlates replication timing (RT) with mutation rates during both evolution and cancer. DNA replication timing, genome stability and cancer: late and/or delayed DNA replication timing is associated with increased genomic instability. Since deleterious mutations can have an effect even as heterozygotes, this mutation accumulation can create an inherited background of late-acting mutations that themselves enhance mutation rate. In addition, this method allows for the unambiguous identification of chromosomal rearrangements that correlate with changes in replication timing that affect the entire chromosome.	yes
243	5545dc7de233d84047000001	Is there a role for transcription factories in genome organization?	"The mammalian nucleus is a highly complex structure that carries out a diverse range of functions such as DNA replication, cell division, RNA processing, and nuclear export/import. Many of these activities occur at discrete subcompartments that intersect with specific regions of the genome. Over the past few decades, evidence has accumulated to suggest that RNA transcription also occurs in specialized sites, called transcription factories, that may influence how the genome is organized. There may be certain efficiency benefits to cluster transcriptional activity in this way. However, the clustering of genes at transcription factories may have consequences for genome stability, and increase the susceptibility to recurrent chromosomal translocations that lead to cancer In the eukaryotic nucleus, genes are transcribed in transcription factories Based on this analysis, we propose that transcription factories result from the aggregation of RNA polymerase II-containing pre-initiation complexes assembled next to each other in the nuclear space. Such an aggregation can be triggered by the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II molecules and their interaction with various transcription factors. Individual transcription factories would thus incorporate tissue-specific, co-regulated as well as housekeeping genes based only on their initial proximity to each other in the nuclear space active polymerases cluster into replication and transcription ""factories"" in both pro- and eukaryotes. We conclude that the second law of thermodynamics acts through nonspecific entropic forces between engaged polymerases to drive the self-organization of genomes into loops containing several thousands (and sometimes millions) of basepairs Since the advent of FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization), there have been major advances in our understanding of how the genome is organized in interphase nuclei. Indeed, this organization is found to be non-random and individual chromosomes occupy discrete regions known as territories  in proliferating cells, there is evidently a correlation between radial positioning and gene density. Indeed, gene-poor chromosomes tend to be located towards the nuclear edge, while those that are more gene-rich are positioned more internally Recently described active chromatin hubs and transcription factories also involve long-range interactions The transcription factory model has implications for the regulation of transcription initiation and elongation, for the organization of genes in the genome, for the co-regulation of genes and for genome instability."	yes
261	52e01f8f98d023950500000f	Is it possible to purify pseudopodia to be used for proteomic analysis?	we developed an approach to biochemically isolate the pseudopodium from the cell body using 3.0-micrometer porous filters for large-scale quantitative proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis. Recent work using unique subcellular fractionation methodologies combined with spatial genomic, proteomic, and phosphoproteomic profiling has provided insight into the invadopodiome and pseudopodiome signaling networks  ere, we purified the pseudopodial proteomes tumor cells were placed on a fibronectin-coated porous membrane to form pseudopodia. According to the motile potentials of the cells, the cells formed pseudopodial microprocesses in the pores. An excimer laser, which was used for ophthalmic refractive surgeries, horizontally ablated cells at the membrane surface to remove the cell body.  we describe methods for the immunoaffinity purification of phosphotyrosine proteins (pY) from pseudopodia that have been isolated from migratory cells. These methods are compatible with current mass spectrometry-based protein identification technologies and can be utilized for the large-scale identification of the pseudopodium pY proteome in various migratory cell lines, including primary and cancer cells.	yes
285	56d1accb67f0cb3d66000001	Are Drosophila ultraconserved elements candidate ncRNAs?	Highly constrained intergenic Drosophila ultraconserved elements are candidate ncRNAs. Here, we report the discovery and characterization of UCEs from 12 sequenced Drosophila species. We identified 98 elements ≥80 bp long with very high conservation across the Drosophila phylogeny. Population genetic analyses reveal that these UCEs are not present in mutational cold spots. Instead we infer that they experience a level of selective constraint almost 10-fold higher compared with missense mutations in protein-coding sequences, which is substantially higher than that observed previously for human UCEs. About one-half of these Drosophila UCEs overlap the transcribed portion of genes, with many of those that are within coding sequences likely to correspond to sites of ADAR-dependent RNA editing. For the remaining UCEs that are in nongenic regions, we find that many are potentially capable of forming RNA secondary structures. Among ten chosen for further analysis, we discovered that the majority are transcribed in multiple tissues of Drosophila melanogaster. We conclude that Drosophila species are rich with UCEs and that many of them may correspond to novel noncoding RNAs.

293	5162a089298dcd4e51000043	Have microRNAs been implicated in pharmacogenomics? 	A major discovery is the ability of miRNAs to determine the efficacy of drugs, which has given rise to the field of 'miRNA pharmacogenomics' through 'Pharmaco-miRs'. miRNAs play a significant role in pharmacogenomics by down-regulating genes that are important for drug function. The potential modulation of toxicology-related changes in miRNA expression, the role of miRNA in immune-mediated drug-induced liver injuries, the use of circulating miRNAs in body fluids as potential toxicological biomarkers, and the link between miRNA-related pharmacogenomics and adverse drug reactions are highlighted. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the miRNA target sequences may affect or impair the binding of miRNAs. Studies have shown that SNPs in miRNA target sites (miR-TS-SNPs) have a great influence on diverse biological functions, including pharmacogenomics and disease susceptibilities in human. Pharmacogenomics genes can be divided into drug target genes termed as pharmacodynamics genes (PD) and genes involved in drug transport and metabolism termed as pharmacokinetics genes (PK). To clarify the regulatory potential of miRNAs in pharmacogenomics, we have examined the potential regulation by miRNAs of PK and PD genes. Our analysis identify a striking difference in the level of miRNA regulation between PK and PD genes, with the former having less than half predicted conserved miRNA binding sites compared with the latter. Importantly, this finding is reflected in a highly significant difference in the shift in expression levels of PD versus PK genes after depletion of miRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: Our study emphasizes an intrinsic difference between PK and PD genes and helps clarify the role of miRNAs in pharmacogenomics. Pharmacogenomics, toxicogenomics, and small RNA expression analysis are three of the most active research topics in the biological, biomedical, pharmaceutical, and toxicological fields. All of these studies are based on gene expression analysis, which requires reference genes to reduce the variations derived from different amounts of starting materials and different efficiencies of RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. In contrast, hTBCA and small RNAs are more stable during drug treatment, and they are better reference genes for pharmacogenomics and toxicogenomics studies. Polymorphisms of genes involved in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic processes underlie the divergent drug responses among individuals. A panel of drug-response genes was constructed, which contains 923 pharmacokinetic genes, 703 pharmacodynamic genes and 720 miRNAs. miRNA variations can affect drug resistance, efficacy, and metabolism, opening new avenues of pharmacogenomics research. we studied the pharmacologic roles of three microRNAs previously implicated in cancer biology (let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21) and also used in silico methods to test pharmacologic microRNA effects more broadly. n silico comparison of drug potencies with microRNA expression profiles across the entire NCI-60 panel revealed that approximately 30 microRNAs, including mir-21, show highly significant correlations with numerous anticancer agents. Ten of those microRNAs have already been implicated in cancer biology. Our results support a substantial role for microRNAs in anticancer drug response, suggesting novel potential approaches to the improvement of chemotherapy. The NCI-60 has also been profiled for mRNA and protein expression, mutational status, chromosomal aberrations, and DNA copy number, generating an unparalleled public resource for integrated chemogenomic studies. To complement the existing NCI-60 data sets, we have measured expression levels of microRNAs in the NCI-60 and incorporated the resulting data into the CellMiner program package for integrative analysis. . Comparison of microRNA expression patterns and compound potency patterns showed significant correlations, suggesting that microRNAs may play a role in chemoresistance. Combined with gene expression and other biological data using multivariate analysis, microRNA expression profiles may provide a critical link for understanding mechanisms involved in chemosensitivity and chemoresistance. This study reports on miRNAs implicated in SSRI sensitivity of LCLs. these miRNAs as tentative SSRI response biomarkers awaits validation with lymphocyte samples of major depression patients.	yes
294	56c03d1fef6e39474100001a	Is nicotinamide effective for skin cancer prevention?	Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) has been shown to have protective effects against damage caused by UV radiation and to reduce the rate of new premalignant actinic keratoses. ESULTS: At 12 months, the rate of new nonmelanoma skin cancers was lower by 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4 to 38) in the nicotinamide group than in the placebo group (P=0.02). Similar differences were found between the nicotinamide group and the placebo group with respect to new basal-cell carcinomas (20% [95% CI, -6 to 39]lower rate with nicotinamide, P=0.12) and new squamous-cell carcinomas (30% [95% CI, 0 to 51] lower rate, P=0.05). The number of actinic keratoses was 11% lower in the nicotinamide group than in the placebo group at 3 months (P=0.01), 14% lower at 6 months (P<0.001), 20% lower at 9 months (P<0.001), and 13% lower at 12 months (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients. Nicotinamide is a safe, widely available vitamin that reduces the immune suppressive effects of UV, enhances DNA repair in keratinocytes and has shown promise in the chemoprevention of non-melanoma skin cancer.   In summary, nicotinamide, by enhancing DNA repair in melanocytes, is a potential agent for the chemoprevention of cutaneous melanoma. Recent double-blinded randomized controlled Phase 2 studies in heavily sun-damaged individuals have shown that oral nicotinamide significantly reduces premalignant actinic keratoses, and may reduce new non-melanoma skin cancers.  Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) prevents UV-induced immunosuppression and carcinogenesis in mice, and solar-simulated (ss) UV-induced immunosuppression in humans. These results show that nicotinamide enhances two different pathways for repair of UV-induced photolesions, supporting nicotinamide's potential as an inexpensive, convenient and non-toxic agent for skin cancer chemoprevention. Recent double-blinded randomized controlled Phase 2 studies in heavily sun-damaged individuals have shown that oral nicotinamide significantly reduces premalignant actinic keratoses, and may reduce new non-melanoma skin cancers. No noteworthy between-group differences were found with respect to the number or types of adverse events during the 12-month intervention period, and there was no evidence of benefit after nicotinamide was discontinued.CONCLUSIONS: Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients.  Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) has been shown to have protective effects against damage caused by UV radiation and to reduce the rate of new premalignant actinic keratoses.METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, we randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, 386 participants who had had at least two nonmelanoma skin cancers in the previous 5 years to receive 500 mg of nicotinamide twice daily or placebo for 12 months.  Similar differences were found between the nicotinamide group and the placebo group with respect to new basal-cell carcinomas (20% [95% CI, -6 to 39]lower rate with nicotinamide, P=0.12) and new squamous-cell carcinomas (30% [95% CI, 0 to 51] lower rate, P=0.05).  Oral nicotinamide was safe and effective in reducing the rates of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in high-risk patients. Nicotinamide has shown potential as a safe and effective intervention for the prevention of malignant and premalignant skin lesions. Nicotinamide, which protected against both UVB and UVA, is a promising agent for skin cancer prevention.	yes
296	54cf4bc3f693c3b16b00000d	Is there an association between serum interleukin-6 concentrations and outcomes of stroke patients?	 In addition, IL-6 concentrations affect clinical outcomes in ischemic stroke. After appropriate adjustment, the odds ratios for the association of markers and poor outcome (comparing the upper and the lower third) were interleukin-6, 3.1 (95% CI: 1.9-5.0); C-reactive protein, 1.9 (95% CI: 1.2-3.1); fibrinogen, 1.5 (95% CI: 1.0-2.36); white cell count, 2.1 (95% CI: 1.3-3.4); and glucose 1.3 (95% CI: 0.8-2.1). The results for interleukin-6 were similar to other studies.  -6 and IL-10 levels were higher in patients with poor outcome. On logistic regression analysis, higher values of IL-6 were significantly associated with clinical outcome at 1 month (odds ratio [OR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.54).  In hemorrhagic stroke, high levels of IL-6 in the early phase indicated a poor neurological outcome. Initially elevated levels of hs-IL-6 at presentation further correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes (by NIHSS and mRs) at both time points. Analysis of variance in the different quartiles identified an hs-IL-6 gradient-dependent correlation at both time points, such that the higher the initial hs-IL-6 concentration, the higher the elevation in inflammatory biomarkers and the poorer the neurological state at both time points (p<0.001 for NIHSS and p=0.001 for mRs, for trend across quartiles). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential of employing hs-IL-6 as an early stage biomarker for the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke.  Another negative correlation was found between IL-6 and CNS scores (r = -0.451, p = 0.000). In addition, increased levels of IL-6 and reduced levels of protein C and protein S may play a role in acute ischemic stroke severity. Variables that are predictors of adverse stroke outcome include erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and intercellular adhesion molecule-1. 	yes
303	530cf4fe960c95ad0c00000c	Can desvenlafaxine be used at a dose of 50mg/day?	Long-term use of desvenlafaxine was safe and well tolerated, with a clinical benefit/risk profile similar to that in other populations. e objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term safety of desvenlafaxine for continuation treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in Japanese patients. This was a phase 3, multicenter, 10-month, open-label study with flexible dosing of desvenlafaxine (25, 50, 100 mg/day) n an effort to establish the lowest effective dose of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), we assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 10- and 50-mg/day desvenlafaxine vs placebo for the treatment of major depressive disorder Change from baseline to final evaluation in adjusted HAM-D(17) total scores was not significantly different comparing desvenlafaxine 10 mg/day (-9.28) and desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day (-8.92) with placebo (-8.42) Overall rates of treatment-emergent adverse events with both doses were similar to placebo However, in a companion study reported separately, desvenlafaxine 50 mg, but not 25 mg, separated from placebo. Taken together, these studies suggest that 50 mg is the minimum effective dose of desvenlafaxine for the treatment of major depressive disorder.  Desvenlafaxine XR was dosed at 50 mg/day for 10 days. Desvenlafaxine therapy is initiated at the therapeutic dose (50 mg/day) without a need for dose titration. Clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of DVS in doses ranging from 50 to 400 mg/day for the treatment of MDD in adult outpatients. The effects of DVS 50 mg/day have been clearly distinguished from placebo in the reduction of MDD symptoms in such clinical trials. No additional therapeutic benefits were found at doses > 50 mg/day. The recommended dose of DVS ranges from 50 to 100 mg. Adult outpatients with major depressive disorder received desvenlafaxine doses ranging from 50-400 mg/day or placebo for 8 weeks  At the recommended therapeutic dose of 50 mg/day, discontinuation due to adverse events was similar to placebo atients received fixed (50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/day; n=1,342) or flexible doses (100-400 mg/day; n=463) of desvenlafaxine or placebo (n=1,108) Desvenlafaxine demonstrated short-term efficacy for treating major depressive disorder across the range of doses studied. No evidence of greater efficacy was observed with doses >50 mg/day; a strong dose-response effect on tolerability was observed. To assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 50- and 100-mg/day doses of desvenlafaxine (administered as desvenlafaxine succinate), a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) Patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) MDD and 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D(17)) scores > or =20 were randomly assigned to double-blind placebo or desvenlafaxine treatment (fixed dose of 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Desvenlafaxine 50 mg was associated with a significantly greater adjusted mean change from baseline on the HAM-D(17) (-11.5) compared with placebo (-9.5, p=0.018)  These results demonstrate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of desvenlafaxine 50 mg/day for treating MDD.  CONCLUSIONS: Desvenlafaxine at the recommended dose of 50 mg/d was effective in relapse prevention of depression during a 6-month period in patients who demonstrated stable response after 20 weeks of open-label desvenlafaxine treatment.	yes
304	530cf4fe960c95ad0c00000d	Can ferric carboxymaltose be used to treat anemia in inflammatory bowel disease patients?	Intravenous iron should be preferred where oral iron is poorly tolerated or where it has failed in moderate to severe anemia, and in combination with erythropoietin Ferric carboxymaltose is much more convenient, and has been shown to be more effective than iron sucrose in a large randomized tria nemia and iron deficiency anemia are very common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD Ferric carboxymaltose was associated with cost savings of 30-44 % per patient per treatment cycle compared to iron sucrose.  Iron deficiency is common in pregnancy, postpartum, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic heart failure, heavy uterine bleeding, cancer and following surgery. We estimate the budget impact (BI) on the Swiss mandatory health insurance associated with substituting iron sucrose (standard) with ferric carboxymaltose (new treatment) using real-life data. reating iron deficiency involves substantial costs to the Swiss MHI which may be reduced by substituting iron sucrose with ferric carboxymaltose. e aim of this study was to observe, in a non-interventional way, how Swedish gastroenterologists adhere to guidelines in IBD outpatients treated with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose (FCM), and the result of treatment FCM lowers platelet counts and platelet activation in patients with IBD-associated secondary thrombocytosis. We performed a randomized, single-blinded placebo-controlled trial testing the effect of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in patients with IBD with secondary thrombocytosis (platelets > 450 G/L) e performed a randomized, placebo-controlled trial to determine if administration of ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) prevents anemia in patients with IBD and low levels of serum ferritin FCM prevents recurrence of anemia in patients with IBD, compared with placebo.   A subgroup was analyzed regarding efficacy and side effects of iron supplementation with ferric carboxymaltose. Iron deficiency and anemia are frequent in IBD patients. Treatment with ferric carboxymaltose is efficious, safe and well tolerated in iron-deficient IBD patients.  Intravenous iron avoids these concerns, especially with the development of ferric carboxymaltose, which allow up to 1000mg to be given rapidly. What is the optimal treatment for anemia in inflammatory bowel disease? We compared the efficacy and safety of a novel fixed-dose ferric carboxymaltose regimen (FCM) with individually calculated iron sucrose (IS) doses in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and IDA Study drugs were well tolerated and drug-related adverse events were in line with drug-specific clinical experience  The simpler FCM-based dosing regimen showed better efficacy and compliance, as well as a good safety profile, compared with the Ganzoni-calculated IS dose regimen. Ferric carboxymaltose can be rapidly administered in doses of 15 mg/kg body weight, up to a ceiling dose of 1000 mg. A test dose is not required, and it can be used more widely across a spectrum of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia indication  Intravenous iron offers a rapid means of iron repletion and is superior to oral iron in many circumstances, especially in the presence of anemia of chronic disease, where it appears to overcome the block to absorption of iron from the gastrointestinal tract and immobilization of stored iron. The clinical situations where high doses of iron are commonly required are reviewed. These include nondialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, obstetrics, menorrhagia, and anemia associated with cancer and its treatment.  Ferric carboxymaltose can be administered at 15 mg/kg body weight to a maximum dose of 1000 mg, whereas iron isomaltoside 1000 can be administered at 20 mg/kg body weight. The ability to give high doses of iron is important in the context of managing iron deficiency anemia in a number of clinical conditions where demands for iron are high (including chronic blood loss associated with inflammatory bowel disease, menorrhagia, and chronic kidney disease) erric carboxymaltose (FCM, Ferinject) was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) in nine, Phase III, randomized, controlled, multicenter trials in a diverse range of indications, including patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), post-partum anemia (PPA) or abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), chronic heart failure (CHF), non-dialysis-dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) and those undergoing hemodialysis (HD In patients with IBD or PPA, improvements in Hb levels were more rapid with FCM than with FeSulf.  CM improved patient quality of life to an equivalent extent to oral FeSulf in patients with IBD or PPA, and to a greater extent than oral FeSulf in women with AUB Four different products are principally used in clinical practice, which differ in their pharmacokinetic properties and safety profiles: iron gluconate and iron sucrose (lower single doses), and iron dextran and ferric carboxymaltose (higher single doses). he prevalence of anemia across studies on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is high (30%).  novel intravenous iron formulation for treatment of anemia in inflammatory bowel disease: the ferric carboxymaltose (FERINJECT) randomized controlled trial. FeCarb is effective and safe in IBD-associated anemia. It is noninferior to FeSulf in terms of Hb change over 12 wk, and provides a fast Hb increase and a sufficient refill of iron stores. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 28.5% of the FeCarb and 22.2% of the FeSulf groups, with discontinuation of study medication due to AEs in 1.5% and 7.9%, respectively. The median Hb improved from 8.7 to 12.3 g/dL in the FeCarb group and from 9.1 to 12.1 g/dL in the FeSulf group, demonstrating noninferiority (P= 0.6967).

319	52ffb5d12059c6d71c00007c	Is the PTPN22 gene a biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis?	TPN22 is a tyrosine phosphatase and functions as a damper of TCR signals. A C-to-T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located at position 1858 of human PTPN22 cDNA and converting an arginine (R620) to tryptophan (W620) confers the highest risk of rheumatoid arthritis among non-HLA genetic variations that are known to be associated with this disease 21 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have previously been associated with RA, including PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, CTLA4, PADI4, STAT4, FCRL3, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, KIF5A-PIP4K2C, IL2RB, TNFAIP3, IL10-1082G/A and REL he HLA locus, particularly HLA-DRB1, is its strongest genetic risk determinant across ethnicities. Several other genes, including PTPN22 and PADI4, show modest association with RA.  Several alleles in the epitope-recognition part of the HLA molecule that show the highest association with RA susceptibility, also share a common string of amminoacid residues (the so-called shared-epitope hypothesis). Other variants in potentially pathogenic genes located in non-MHC regions have been implicated by recently performed genome wide analysis studies. These genes include PTPN22, TRAF1-C5, PADI4, STAT4.  n particular, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have provided supportive evidence that RA is a disease with a strong genetic background. Interestingly, a series of candidate genes have been identified outside of the classical major histocompatibility (MHC) locus, which had long been regarded as the major contributor to the pathogenesis of this disease. Among these genes, PTPN22 plays an outstanding role. ssociation of the PTPN22 gene (-1123G > C) polymorphism with rheumatoid arthritis in Chinese patients Eight markers (ie, rs1160542 (AFF3), rs1678542 (KIF5A), rs2476601 (PTPN22), rs3087243 (CTLA4), rs4810485 (CD40), rs5029937 (6q23), rs10760130 (TRAF1/C5) and rs7574865 (STAT4)) were significantly associated with RA by meta-analysis Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on RA identified known and novel susceptibility genes like HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, TRAF1/C5, OLIG3/TNFAIP3, CD40, CCL21, MMEL1-TNFRSF14, CDK6, PRKCQ, IL2RB, and KIF5A-PIP4K2C.  This study investigated five confirmed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) susceptibility genes/loci (HLA-DRB1, PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5) for association with susceptibility and severity in an inception cohort After initial completion of the Human Genome Project on the 16th February 2001, significant progress has been made in identifying other than HLA genome regions linked to the increased RA susceptibility. As an effect several new genes have been recognized as an HLA-independent genetic risk factors of RA. PTPN22 gene polymorphism, C5/TRAF1 genes region polymorphism and TNFAIP3-OLIG3 genes region polymorphism(s) are among newly identified and already confirmed genetic risk factors As well as the major susceptibility gene HLA-DRB1, recent genome-wide and candidate-gene studies reported additional evidence for association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in the PTPN22, STAT4, OLIG3/TNFAIP3 and TRAF1/C5 loci with RA. Recent advances have led to novel identification of genetic polymorphisms that are associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Currently, 5 loci (HLA, PTPN22, TRAF1/C5, TNFAIP3, and STAT4) have been consistently reported, whereas others have been observed less systematically However, inconsistent results of the contributions of non-HLA susceptibility genes have been described, with the exception of a few genes repeatedly associated with RA-susceptibility, such as PTPN22 gene in populations of European ancestry and PADI4 gene in populations of Asian ancestry, revealing the presence of genetic heterogeneity in RA.  In conclusion, we have confirmed that PTPN22 620W allele is associated with Tunisian RA but does not constitute a factor influencing clinical manifestations.  After adjusting for smoking and reproductive factors, PTPN22 was associated with RA risk among Caucasian women in these cohorts We found strong evidence of an association of PTPN22 with the development of anti-citrulline antibody-positive RA (odds ratio [OR] 1.49; P=.00002), using previously untested EIRA samples. Although HLA-DRB1 is the main RA gene, it accounts for only part of the familial risk for RA. HLA-DRB1 alleles are neither necessary nor sufficient to cause the development of RA in a given individual. Several genome scans conducted in populations from France, Japan, North America and UK have confirmed the role of the HLA region and suggested several other susceptibility loci. Association studies support a role for several genes, including TNFR2, PADI4, SLC22A4, RUNX1, and PTPN22. the level of PTPN22.6 in peripheral blood correlates with disease activity of rheumatoid arthritis PTPN22, PADI-4, and CTLA-4 have been associated with risk for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) progression from undifferentiated arthritis to rheumatoid arthritis: the effect of the PTPN22 1858T-allele In this Dutch cohort of UA-patients, the PTPN22 1858T allele does not markedly improve individual decision-making to predict RA-development challenges in identifying genetic polymorphisms that influence the susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis are the same as those faced in most complex diseases Recently a number of convincing candidate genes have begun to emerge and an update has been provided for three of these: PTPN22	yes
328	56e0797451531f7e3300000f	Are optogenetics tools used in the study and treatment of epilepsy?	The emerging revolutionary technique of optogenetics enables manipulation of the activity of specific neuronal populations in vivo with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution using light. We used optogenetic approaches to test the role of hippocampal excitatory neurons in the lithium-pilocarpine model of acute elicited seizures in awake behaving rats. This chapter focuses on the development of optogenetics and on-demand technologies for the study of epilepsy and the control of seizures. We then turn to the use of optogenetics, including on-demand optogenetics in the study of epilepsies, which highlights the powerful potential of optogenetics for epilepsy research. Optogenetic techniques provide powerful tools for bidirectional control of neuronal activity and investigating alterations occurring in excitability disorders, such as epilepsy.  Therefore, one could optogenetically activate specific or a mixed population of interneurons and dissect their selective or concerted inhibitory action on principal cells. We chose to explore a conceptually novel strategy involving simultaneous activation of mixed populations of interneurons by optogenetics and study their impact on ongoing epileptiform activity in mouse acute hippocampal slices. Our data suggest that global optogenetic activation of mixed interneuron populations is a more effective approach for development of novel therapeutic strategies for epilepsy, but the initial action potential generation in principal neurons needs to be taken in consideration. Recently, a number of experiments have explored the treatments for epilepsy with optogenetic control of neurons. Here, we discuss the possibility that an optogenetic approach could be used to control the release of gliotransmitters and improve astrocyte function such as glutamate and K(+) uptake, and thereby offer a potential strategy to investigate and treat astrocyte-related epilepsy. Optogenetic and designer receptor technologies provide unprecedented and much needed specificity, allowing for spatial, temporal and cell type-selective modulation of neuronal circuits. Using such tools, it is now possible to begin to address some of the fundamental unanswered questions in epilepsy, to dissect epileptic neuronal circuits and to develop new intervention strategies.  We then turn to the use of optogenetics, including on-demand optogenetics in the study of epilepsies, which highlights the powerful potential of optogenetics for epilepsy research. Moreover, optogenetics may be considered for developing potential treatment strategies for brain diseases, particularly for excitability disorders such as epilepsy. This chapter focuses on the development of optogenetics and on-demand technologies for the study of epilepsy and the control of seizures. How might novel technologies such as optogenetics lead to better treatments in epilepsy? WONOEP appraisal: optogenetic tools to suppress seizures and explore the mechanisms of epileptogenesis. Finally, optogenetic tools allow rapid and reversible suppression of epileptic electroencephalography (EEG) activity upon photoactivation. Our data suggest that epileptiform activity in the hippocampus caused by impaired inhibition may be controlled by optogenetic silencing of principal neurons and potentially can be developed as an alternative treatment for epilepsy. Seizure suppression by high frequency optogenetic stimulation using in vitro and in vivo animal models of epilepsy. Optogenetic techniques provide powerful tools for bidirectional control of neuronal activity and investigating alterations occurring in excitability disorders, such as epilepsy.  We first discuss the benefits and caveats to using optogenetic approaches and recent advances in optogenetics related tools. We then turn to the use of optogenetics, including on-demand optogenetics in the study of epilepsies, which highlights the powerful potential of optogenetics for epilepsy research.	yes
347	5321b8a39b2d7acc7e000009	Is there a relation between ANP and transcapillary albumin escape?	Thus, in a large ethnically homogeneous cohort of diabetic subjects, our data show: (1) a significant association of C708/T polymorphism with microalbuminuria in long-term diabetes and with both lower plasma ANP levels and widespread albumin leakage hese results suggest a possible role of PND gene in conferring protection from nephropathy and microvascular damage in type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the increased susceptibility of the glomerular capillaries in diabetics to ANP seems to be part of a more generalized capillary abnormality, because ANP also increases the transcapillary escape of albumin. In summary, low dose ANP infusion in healthy subjects caused a shift of plasma water and electrolytes from the circulation, with albumin escape as a secondary phenomenon.	yes
358	530cf4fe960c95ad0c000005	Is the ACE inhibitor indicated for lung cancer treatment?	The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used widely as antihypertensive agents, and it has been suggested that they decrease the risk of some cancers, although available data are conflicting.  Using cell viability and fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis tests, we demonstrated that captopril inhibited the viability of LNM35 cells by inducing apoptosis, providing insight about the mechanisms underlying its antitumorigenic activities. In view of these experimental findings, we conclude that captopril could be a promising option for the treatment of lung cancer. In order to determine the mechanism by which captopril inhibited tumor growth, we investigated the impact of this drug on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that captopril treatment significantly reduced the number of proliferating cells (Ki-67) in the tumor samples but was not associated with inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (CD31). Using this model, we demonstrated that daily IP administration of captopril (2.8 mg/mouse) for 3 weeks resulted in a remarkable reduction of tumor growth (58%, P < 0.01) and lymph node metastasis (50%, P= 0.088).  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been shown to mitigate radiation-induced lung injury in preclinical models ACE inhibitors may decrease the incidence of radiation pneumonitis in patients receiving thoracic radiation for lung cancer.	no

Amiodarone resulted in increased T4, T4/T3 and rT3, whereas dronedarone did not alter the thyroid hormone profile in normal animals. Fifty-five Wistar rats were randomly allocated to a 2-week oral treatment with either vehicle (n=18), amiodarone (30 mg/kg, n=20), or dronedarone (30 mg/kg, n=17). Thyroid function was similar in the 3 groups. Plasma levels of T3, T4, and rT3 were changed after SR 33589 treatment except a decrease in T4 level at the highest dose whilst the T4 T3 ratio and the level of rT3 were dose-dependently increased by amiodarone treatment.	no
374	56c5a7605795f9a73e000002	Does HuR protein regulate the splicing process?	HuR and TIA1/TIAL1 are involved in regulation of alternative splicing of SIRT1 pre-mRNA Here we describe experiments showing that HuR and TIA1/TIAL1, two kinds of RNA-binding proteins, were involved in the regulation of alternative splicing of SIRT1 pre-mRNA under normal and stress circumstances HuR increased SIRT1-∆Exon8 by promoting SIRT1 exon 8 exclusion, whereas TIA1/TIAL1 inhibition of the exon 8 exclusion led to a decrease in SIRT1-∆Exon8 mRNA levels.  HuR regulates alternative splicing of the TRA2β gene in human colon cancer cells under oxidative stress Hu antigen R (HuR) regulates stress responses through stabilizing and/or facilitating the translation of target mRNAs We show here that the RBP embryonic lethal abnormal vision like 1 (ELAVL1, also know as HuR) regulates the alternative splicing of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E nuclear import factor 1 (Eif4enif1), which encodes an eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E transporter (4E-T) protein and suppresses the expression of capped mRNAs Further, endothelial-specific Elavl1 knockout mice exhibited reduced revascularization after hind limb ischemia and tumor angiogenesis in oncogene-induced mammary cancer, resulting in attenuated blood flow and tumor growth, respectively.  Changes in cellular mRNA stability, splicing, and polyadenylation through HuR protein sequestration by a cytoplasmic RNA virus Furthermore, significant changes can be observed in nuclear alternative polyadenylation and splicing events on cellular pre-mRNAs as a result of sequestration of HuR protein by the 3' UTR of transcripts of this cytoplasmic RNA virus. Here we demonstrate that expression of 2A(pro) induces a selective nucleo-cytoplasm translocation of several important RNA binding proteins and splicing factors. Subcellular fractionation studies, together with immunofluorescence microscopy revealed an asymmetric distribution of HuR and TIA1/TIAR in 2A(pro) expressing cells, which modulates splicing of the human Fas exon 6 knockdown of HuR or overexpression of TIA1/TIAR, leads to Fas exon 6 inclusion in 2A(pro)-expressing cells The differential expression levels of T-cell intracellular antigens (TIA) and Hu antigen R (HuR) are concomitant with a splicing switch in apoptosis receptor Fas in HCT-116 cells overexpression and knockdown of HuR led to Fas exon 6 skipping and inclusion, respectively. These results suggest that the TIA and HuR cellular ratio influences cell-type specific Fas exon 6 splicing pattern. Hu antigen R (HuR) functions as an alternative pre-mRNA splicing regulator of Fas apoptosis-promoting receptor on exon definition antiapoptotic regulator Hu antigen R (HuR, ELAVL1), a member of the embryonic lethal, abnormal vision, Drosophila-like (ELAVL) family, promotes Fas exon 6 skipping by binding to an exonic splicing silencer ELAV/Hu proteins bind to AU-rich elements (ARE) in mRNAs and regulate their stability from splicing to translation, and the ubiquitous HuR protein has been implicated in cancerous cell growth. The HuR protein regulates the expression of thousands of cellular transcripts by modulating mRNA splicing, trafficking, translation, and stability. Hu antigen R (HuR) functions as an alternative pre-mRNA splicing regulator of Fas apoptosis-promoting receptor on exon definition. I report that antiapoptotic regulator Hu antigen R (HuR, ELAVL1), a member of the embryonic lethal, abnormal vision, Drosophila-like (ELAVL) family, promotes Fas exon 6 skipping by binding to an exonic splicing silencer.  Changes in cellular mRNA stability, splicing, and polyadenylation through HuR protein sequestration by a cytoplasmic RNA virus. Further, the silencing capacity of HuR as splicing regulator resides in the RRM1 and hinge-RRM3 domains.  HuR and TIA1/TIAL1 are involved in regulation of alternative splicing of SIRT1 pre-mRNA. HuR regulates alternative splicing of the TRA2β gene in human colon cancer cells under oxidative stress. The HuR protein regulates the expression of thousands of cellular transcripts by modulating mRNA splicing, trafficking, translation, and stability.  Further, the silencing capacity of HuR as splicing regulator resides in the RRM1 and hinge-RRM3 domains. Taken together, these results support a functional link between HuR as repressor of alternative Fas splicing and the molecular mechanisms modulating programmed cell death. We are interested in interactions involving hnRNP proteins participating in several steps of mRNA processing (mainly pre-mRNA splicing) and HuR with an established role in stability/translation of associated mRNAs. hnRNP and HuR proteins have a major nucleoplasmic localization and ability to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm. We report here on interactions between hnRNP and HuR proteins that were identified in the context of isolated hnRNP and mRNP complexes.  Despite the fact that HuR sites are observed in intronic regions, our data do not support a role for HuR in regulating splicing.	yes
380	54fc845e6ea36a810c000005	Was modafinil tested for schizophrenia treatment?	Modafinil improves antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism but not excessive daytime sleepiness, psychiatric symptoms or cognition in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that modafinil was a safe adjunctive treatment which improved parkinsonian symptoms and signs in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  A review of its effects in schizophrenia suggests that modafinil facilitates cognitive functions, with pro-mnemonic effects and problem solving improvements. Emotional processing also appears to be enhanced by the drug, although to date there are only a limited number of studies. BACKGROUND: Modafinil, a putative cognitive enhancing drug, has previously been shown to improve performance of healthy volunteers as well as patients with attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia, mainly in tests of executive functions.  A review of modafinil and armodafinil as add-on therapy in antipsychotic-treated patients with schizophrenia. It has been suggested that modafinil and its isomer armodafinil as an add-on strategy to antipsychotic treatment in patients with schizophrenia may improve cognitive functioning, attenuate fatigue, inactiveness and other negative functions as well as weight gain. Evidence for the use of modafinil or armodafinil as add-on therapy to antipsychotic drugs to alleviate fatigue, sleepiness and inactivity is inconclusive. One cohort study and one out of two single-dose crossover RCTs in which modafinil addition was studied could demonstrate a positive effect. All five RCTs of modafinil (three RCTs) and armodafinil (two RCTs) addition with a longer study duration could not demonstrate a positive effect.  In RCTs with a treatment duration of 4 weeks or more, however, no positive effect could be demonstrated on cognitive functioning with modafinil and armodafinil addition. Yet, four single-dose crossover RCTs of modafinil addition show significant positive effects on executive functioning, verbal memory span, visual memory, working memory, spatial planning, slowing in latency, impulse control and recognition of faces expressing sadness and sadness misattribution in the context of disgust recognition. The addition of modafinil or armodafinil to an antipsychotic regime, despite theoretical and preclinical considerations, has not been proved to enhance cognitive function, attenuate fatigue, enhance activity, improve negative symptoms and reduce weight in patients with schizophrenia. RATIONAL: In recent years, evidence suggests that modafinil may be useful for certain symptom domains of schizophrenia, especially for the negative and cognitive symptoms.  CONCLUSION: The present study indicates modafinil as a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for treatment of schizophrenia particularly the negative symptoms.  Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug that has been shown to improve attention, memory and executive function in the healthy population and in patients with schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot trial do not support routine use of modafinil to counteract increased weight and metabolic diseases in patients taking clozapine. Modafinil (2-((diphenylmethyl)sulfinyl)acetamide) is described as an atypical stimulant and is a putative cognition enhancer for schizophrenia, but the precise mechanisms of action remain unclear. Modafinil is a wake-promoting drug that has been shown to improve emotion discrimination in healthy individuals and attention and executive function in schizophrenia.  CONCLUSIONS: These data support clinical evidence that modafinil may alleviate cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and also demonstrate the benefit of applying PLSR modeling to characterize functional brain networks in translational models relevant to central nervous system dysfunction. Modafinil improves working memory in healthy subjects and individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, though the effects of modafinil have not been evaluated on working memory in methamphetamine-dependent subjects. Modafinil is a psychostimulant approved for treating excessive sleepiness in adults; off-label uses (e.g., treatment of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, ADHD and age-related dementias) are currently being explored.  CONCLUSIONS: Results of this pilot trial do not support routine use of modafinil to treat negative symptoms, cognitive deficits, or wakefulness/fatigue in patients on clozapine. We have previously shown that the amount of movement exhibited by patients with schizophrenia is positively correlated with the volume of left anterior cingulate cortex and that this quantity of movement can be increased by modafinil.  OBJECTIVE: Given recent reports about the off-label use of modafinil as an adjuvant for the treatment of antipsychotic-associated sedation in schizophrenia patients and the recent interest in its putative cognitive-enhancing effects in this population, we present a systematic review of available data on trials of modafinil as an adjuvant in the treatment of cognitive deficits, negative symptoms, and antipsychotic-induced fatigue, and its tolerability.  RESULTS: One of 4 reviewed studies found a significant effect of modafinil as an alerting agent for antipsychotic-induced fatigue and sedation. Neither of 2 reviewed studies found modafinil to improve negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Three of 6 reviewed studies showed that modafinil may improve short-term memory, attention, and the ability to shift mental sets.  CONCLUSIONS: While the available data suggest that modafinil is generally well tolerated and may have some efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced sedation and cognitive domains, the small sample sizes, contradictory results, and methodological differences between trials, especially with respect to cognitive testing, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the overall effectiveness of modafinil as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia.  Hence, before prescribing modafinil to a schizophrenia patient, the possible risks and benefits of each particular case should be evaluated. Modafinil had a substantial placebo effect on outcomes such as fatigue, excessive sleepiness and depression in patients with traumatic brain injury, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, post-polio fatigue and multiple sclerosis; however, it did not provide any benefit greater than placebo. RATIONALE: The wake-promoting agent modafinil selectively improves neuropsychological task performance in healthy volunteers, in adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and in schizophrenia.  Recently, however, modafinil has been shown to improve attentional set-shifting performance in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, modafinil shows initial promise for a variety of off-label indications in psychiatry, including treatment-resistant depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and schizophrenia. There is increasing interest in the use of modafinil to improve cognition in schizophrenia as well as in other disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Initial findings indicate that modafinil may lead to better executive functioning and attentional performance in patients with schizophrenia.  CONCLUSIONS: Although no effect on negative symptoms was found, adjunctive therapy with modafinil may result in global improvements in patients with schizophrenia who have prominent negative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil did not improve cognitive control in all schizophrenia patients. . These data suggest that modafinil increases quantifiable motor behaviour in schizophrenia and may have an impact on avolition. One patient was on treatment with both modafinil and trazodone and reported no change after tapering each in separate discontinuation trials, while another 3 patients were taking sleeping medications and also noted no change after discontinuation.  Neuroprotective agents as add-on therapies (e.g., modafinil, erythropoietin, glycine, D-serine, memantine and celecoxib) are currently being evaluated in schizophrenia and related disorders.  In the modafinil (N = 10) and placebo (N = 10) groups, fatigue improved significantly over time (p < .01), but there were no differences between groups on changes in fatigue, positive and negative symptoms, or cognition.  CONCLUSIONS: Modafinil modulates anterior cingulate cortex function in chronic schizophrenia but its beneficial cognitive effects may be restricted to a subset of patients requiring further characterisation. Modafinil significantly improved overall clinical condition, with 64% and 82% of patients rated as clinically improved at week 4 by a blinded clinician and the investigator respectively. Modafinil significantly improved fatigue (P = 0.025, week 3) and tended to improve cognitive functioning scores.  Although preliminary, these results suggest modafinil may be an effective and well-tolerated adjunct treatment that improves global functioning and clinical condition, and reduces fatigue in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.  Modafinil had some cognitive enhancing properties in schizophrenia similar to those observed in healthy adults and adult patients with ADHD.  Modafinil may have potential as an important therapy for cognitive impairment in patients with schizophrenia, particularly because of its beneficial effects on attentional set shifting. While the available data suggest that modafinil is generally well tolerated and may have some efficacy in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced sedation and cognitive domains, the small sample sizes, contradictory results, and methodological differences between trials, especially with respect to cognitive testing, make it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the overall effectiveness of modafinil as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia. Given recent reports about the off-label use of modafinil as an adjuvant for the treatment of antipsychotic-associated sedation in schizophrenia patients and the recent interest in its putative cognitive-enhancing effects in this population, we present a systematic review of available data on trials of modafinil as an adjuvant in the treatment of cognitive deficits, negative symptoms, and antipsychotic-induced fatigue, and its tolerability. The present study indicates modafinil as a potential adjunctive treatment strategy for treatment of schizophrenia particularly the negative symptoms.

397	5319abc9b166e2b80600002d	Is Rac1 involved in cancer cell invasion?	In the Matrigel invasion assay, knockdown of CCR1 and inhibition of the ERK and Rac signaling pathways significantly decreased the number of invading cells. These results demonstrated for the first time that the interaction of CCR1 with CCL5 caused by increased expression of CCR1 promotes invasion of PC3PR cells by increasing secretion of MMPs 2 and 9 and by activating ERK and Rac signaling. These data suggest that P-Rex1 has an influence on physiological migratory processes, such as invasion of cancer cells, both through effects upon classical Rac1-driven motility and a novel association with RTK signalling complexes. Activated PAR1 induced RhoA and Rac1 phosphorylation, and subsequent overexpression of myosin IIA and filamin B which are stress fiber components that were identified by PMF analysis of peptide mass data obtained by MALDI-TOF/MS measurement.  These results demonstrate that PAR1 activation induces cell morphological change associated with cell motility via Rho family activation and cytoskeletal protein overexpression, and has a critical role in gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis. Rac1 was found to be required for actopaxin-induced matrix degradation whereas inhibition of myosin contractility promoted degradation in the phosphomutant-expressing Quint cells, indicating that a balance of Rho GTPase signaling and regulation of cellular tension are important for the process. Taken together, this study demonstrates a new role for actopaxin phosphorylation in matrix degradation and cell invasion via regulation of Rho GTPase signaling. BART inhibits pancreatic cancer cell invasion by Rac1 inactivation through direct binding to active Rac1 We report that Binder of Arl Two (BART) plays a role in inhibiting cell invasion by regulating the activity of the Rho small guanosine triphosphatase protein Rac1 in pancreatic cancer cells. BART interacts with active forms of Rac1, and the BART-Rac1 complex localizes at the leading edges of migrating cancer cells. Suppression of BART increases active Rac1, thereby increasing cell invasion. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells in which BART is stably knocked down with a Rac1 inhibitor decreases invasiveness. Thus, BART-dependent inhibition of cell invasion is likely associated with decreased active Rac1. The Rac1 inhibitor inhibits the lamellipodia formation that is stimulated by suppression of BART. Our results imply that BART regulates actin-cytoskeleton rearrangements at membrane ruffles through modulation of the activity of Rac1, which, in turn, inhibits pancreatic cancer cell invasion. It has been reported as an important inducer of cancer cell migration and invasion, with underlying molecular mechanisms involving the signalling mediated by its juxtamembrane domain, the secretion of matrix metalloproteases to the extracellular media, and the cleavage of a P-cadherin soluble form with pro-invasive activity. Intracellularly, this protein interferes with the endogenous cadherin/catenin complex, inducing p120-catenin delocalization to the cytoplasm, and the consequent activation of Rac1/Cdc42 and associated alterations in the actin cytoskeleton. Targeted down-regulation of RhoC led to sustained activation of Rac1 GTPase and morphological, molecular and phenotypic changes reminiscent of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. We also find that Rac1 GTPase mediates tight binding of prostate cancer cells to bone marrow endothelial cells and promotes retraction of endothelial cells required for tumor cell diapedesis. Finally, Rac1 leads to β1 integrin activation, suggesting a mechanism that Rac1 can mediate tight binding with endothelial cells. Together, our data suggest that Rac1 GTPase is key mediator of prostate cancer cell-bone marrow endothelial cell interactions. Furthermore, expression of dominant-negative Rac1 (T17N) could largely block EGF-induced PI3K/Akt-PAK1 activation and cell migration. Our study demonstrated that EGF-induced cell migration involves a cascade of signalling events, including activation of Rac1, generation of ROS and subsequent activation of PI3K/Akt and PAK1. Small GTPase proteins, including RhoA, RhoB, RhoC, Rac1, and cdc42, are important molecules for linking cell shape and cell-cycle progression because of their role in both cytoskeletal arrangements and mitogenic signaling. The suppression of MMP-2 expression by CTXG led to an inhibition of SW620 cells invasion and migration by inactivating Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA GTPase. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that CTXG exerted anti-invasion action in SW620 cells by targeting MMP-2 though regulating the activities of Rac1, Cdc42 and their downstream transcriptional factor AP-1. ctivation of H-Ras and Rac1 correlates with epidermal growth factor-induced invasion in Hs578T and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells We have previously shown that H-Ras, but not N-Ras, induces an invasive phenotype mediated by small GTPase Rac1 in MCF10A human breast epithelial cells. Moreover, siRNA-knockdown of Rac1 significantly inhibited the EGF-induced invasiveness in these cells. Our data demonstrate that the activation of H-Ras and the downstream molecule Rac1 correlates with EGF-induced breast cancer cell invasion, providing important information on the regulation of malignant progression in mammary carcinoma cells. At 50% growth-inhibiting concentration, icariin significantly suppressed tumor cells migration and invasion, which were traceable to down-regulation of Rac1 and VASP.  These results indicate that icariin exerts negative effects on tumor cell invasion and migration via the Rac1-dependent VASP pathway and may be a potential anti-cancer drug. RhoGDI2 modulates the invasiveness and metastatic ability of cancer cells through regulation of Rac1 activity. We also showed that GBM cells secrete Sema3A endogenously, and RNA interference-mediated downregulation of Sema3A inhibits migration and alters cell morphology that is dependent on Rac1 activity. LMO1 and Dock180, a bipartite Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, promote human glioma cell invasion Here, we report for the first time that engulfment and cell motility 1 (ELMO1) and dedicator of cytokinesis 1 (Dock180), a bipartite Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), are evidently linked to the invasive phenotype of glioma cells. Inhibition of endogenous ELMO1 and Dock180 expression significantly impeded glioma cell invasion in vitro and in brain tissue slices with a concomitant reduction in Rac1 activation. Members of the Rac family of small GTPases are known to act as regulators of actin cytoskeletal structures and strongly influence the cellular processes of integrin-mediated adhesion and migration. Even though hyperactivated Rac proteins have been shown to influence metastatic processes, these proteins have never been directly linked to metastatic progression.  We show that increased activation of Rac proteins directly correlates with increasing metastatic potential in a panel of cell variants derived from a single metastatic breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-435). Expression of a dominant active Rac1 or a dominant active Rac3 resulted in a more invasive and motile phenotype. Moreover, expression of either dominant negative Rac1 or dominant negative Rac3 into the most metastatic cell variant resulted in decreased invasive and motile properties. This study correlates endogenous Rac activity with high metastatic potential and implicates Rac in the regulation of cell migration and invasion in metastatic breast cancer cells. Taken together, these results suggest a role for both the Rac1 and Rac3 GTPases in human breast cancer progression.	yes

OBJECTIVE: We studied pubertal development and fecundity in males with Mulibrey nanism (MUL) caused by mutations in the TRIM37 gene. In MUL, mutations in TRIM37 lead to disturbance of sexual maturation, and fertility is severely compromised.  It is caused by recessive mutations in the TRIM37 gene encoding for the peroxisomal TRIM37 protein with ubiquitin-ligase activity.  Mulibrey nanism is an autosomal recessive growth disorder caused by mutations in the TRIM37 gene encoding a protein of unknown function.  Gynecological tumors in Mulibrey nanism and role for RING finger protein TRIM37 in the pathogenesis of ovarian fibrothecomas. To investigate the possible involvement of TRIM37 alterations in the pathogenesis of sporadic fibrothecomas, we analyzed the TRIM37 cDNA for mutations and alternatively spliced transcripts and TRIM37 expression in fibrothecomas of women without Mulibrey nanism.   In conclusion, inherited biallelic inactivation of TRIM37 (Mulibrey nanism) predisposes to both mesenchymal and epithelial ovarian tumors and dysregulation of TRIM37 may also be involved in the pathogenesis of sporadic fibrothecomas.

418	54f482d264850a5854000009	Is the Histidine-Rich Calcium Binding protein (HRC) related to arrhythmias and cardiac disease?	A human genetic variant (Ser96Ala) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) histidine-rich Ca(2+)-binding (HRC) protein has been linked to ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death in dilated cardiomyopathy.  These findings suggest that aberrant SR Ca2+ release and increased susceptibility to delayed afterdepolarizations underlie triggered arrhythmic activity in human Ala96 HRC carriers. The histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) Ser96Ala polymorphism was shown to correlate with ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death only in dilated cardiomyopathy patients but not in healthy human carriers. These findings indicate that the HRC Ser96Ala variant increases the propensity of arrhythmogenic Ca(2+) waves in the stressed failing heart, suggesting a link between this genetic variant and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in human carriers. HRC plays an important role in myocyte differentiation and in antiapoptotic cardioprotection against ischemia/reperfusion induced cardiac injury. Interestingly, HRC has been linked with familiar cardiac conduction disease and an HRC polymorphism was shown to associate with malignant ventricular arrhythmias in the background of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. This review summarizes studies, which have established the critical role of HRC in Ca(2+)-homeostasis, suggesting its importance in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. HRC is a SR luminal Ca(2+) binding protein known to associate with both triadin and the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, and may thus mediate the crosstalk between SR Ca(2+) uptake and release. Indeed, evidence from genetic models of JCN and HRC indicate that they are important in cardiophysiology as alterations in these proteins affect SR Ca(2+) handling and cardiac function. In addition, downregulation of JCN and HRC may contribute to Ca(2+) cycling perturbations manifest in the failing heart, where their protein levels are significantly reduced. The Ser96Ala genetic variant of HRC is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic DCM and may serve as an independent predictor of susceptibility to arrhythmogenesis in the setting of DCM. AAV-mediated knock-down of HRC exacerbates transverse aorta constriction-induced heart failure. Chronic overexpression of HRC that may disrupt intracellular Ca(2+) homeostasis is implicated in pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy Ablation of HRC showed relatively normal phenotypes under basal condition, but exhibited a significantly increased susceptibility to isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy Our results present evidence that down-regulation of HRC could deteriorate cardiac function in TAC-FH through perturbed SR-mediated Ca(2+) cycling However, AAV9-mediated HRC-KD in TAC-FH was associated with decreased fractional shortening and increased cardiac fibrosis compared with control. Histidine-rich calcium binding protein (HRC) is a high capacity, low affinity Ca(2+) binding protein, specifically expressed in striated muscles of mammals. In rabbit skeletal and cardiac muscles, HRC binds to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes via triadin, a junctional SR protein. Recently, a potential role in heart failure and arrhythmogenesis has been assigned to HRC due to its activity as regulator of SR Ca(2+) uptake and Ca(2+) release. In addition, HRC null mice displayed a significantly exaggerated response to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy by isoproterenol compared to their wild-type littermates. The exaggerated response of HRC knockout mice to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy is consistent with a regulatory role for HRCBP in calcium handling in vivo and suggests that mutations in HRC, in combination with other genetic or environmental factors, might contribute to pathological hypertrophy and heart failure. We observed that the levels of HRC were reduced in animal models and human heart failure. Collectively, these data indicate that alterations in expression levels of HRC are associated with impaired cardiac SR Ca homeostasis and contractile function. Abnormal calcium cycling and cardiac arrhythmias associated with the human Ser96Ala genetic variant of histidine-rich calcium-binding protein. The Ser96Ala variant in histidine-rich calcium-binding protein is associated with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.

420	533581f5d6d3ac6a3400004d	Is Turcot syndrome associated with glioblastoma?	"Turcot syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder clinically characterized by the occurrence of primary tumors of the central nervous system and adenomatous colonic polyps during the first or second decades of life, with a spectrum of clinical features such as ""café-au-lait"" spots, axillary freckling, and hyperpigmented spots.  We present the case of a 20-year-old male with a clinical presentation of both glioblastoma multiforme and multiple adenomatous colonic polyps.  Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare hereditary disorder clinically characterized by the occurrence of primary tumors of the colon and the central nervous system (CNS). Here we present the case of an 11-year-old boy with a synchronous clinical presentation of both glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and colonic adenocarcinoma. Based on this case study, the synchronous presentation of glioblastoma multiforme and adenocarcinoma of the colon might suggest a shorter survival rate for patients with Turcot syndrome.  A 15-year-old boy was admitted with the diagnosis of colonic polyposis, and during a 2-year follow-up, he underwent operation for right parieto-occipital anaplastic astrocytoma, left-side colonic non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and cerebella glioblastoma which were all confirmed by histology. Although cases of Turcot's syndrome (TS) (colonic polyposis and primary brain tumour occurring in the same patient) have been previously described, association with haematological malignancy is rare. We hereby report such a case with TS. Type A microsatellite instability in pediatric gliomas as an indicator of Turcot syndrome.  Biallelic mutations of MMR genes are associated with pediatric cancers, including glial tumors, in Turcot syndrome type 1 (TS1). Glioblastomas with giant cell and sarcomatous features in patients with Turcot syndrome type 1: a clinicopathological study of 3 cases. Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare genetic disorder of DNA mismatch repair predisposing to glioblastoma (GBM) in the type 1 variant.  We report the clinicopathological and genetic features of 3 gliomas in TS type 1 patients. We conclude that 1) the giant cell variant of GBM is overrepresented in TS; 2) gliosarcomas may also be encountered; and 3) survival is often favorable, despite histological anaplasia and exuberant proliferation. Malignant transformation of high-grade astrocytoma associated with neurocysticercosis in a patient with Turcot syndrome. A 45-year-old woman with anaplastic astrocytoma was clinically diagnosed with Turcot syndrome, and subsequently developed simultaneous neurocysticercosis and malignant transformation to glioblastoma.  Familial glioblastoma multiforme is a rather uncommon entity, being in most cases associated to known genetic disorders (as Turcot syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, neurofibromatosis, etc.).  Turcot syndrome (MIM276300) has been described as the association of central nervous system malignant tumors and familial colorectal cancer and has been reported to be both a dominant and recessive disorder. We report here the first identification of a homozygous mutation in MSH6 in a family with childhood-onset brain tumor, lymphoma, colorectal cancer, and neurofibromatosis type 1 phenotype.  Of the 21 patients, 12 have died (10 after relapse, with a median time to progression for the whole series of 14 months; one with intratumoral bleeding at 40 months after diagnosis; and one affected by Turcot syndrome for duodenal cancer relapse). [Glioblastoma multiforme as a manifestation of Turcot syndrome]. In the present case, a 60-year-old patient with glioblastoma multiforme and a history of hereditary malignomas is described as an example of a HNPCC-associated Turcot's syndrome. Computed tomography brain scan and computed tomography-guided biopsy revealed a left frontoparietal glioblastoma multiforme. This case illustrates the rare presentation of Turcot syndrome-a hereditary colorectal polyposis syndrome-in an older adult. Turcot syndrome is the association of colorectal polyposis with primary neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system such as glioblastoma and medulloblastoma.  Brain tumor is mainly diagnosed as glioblastoma or astrocytoma and mismatch repair genes might be involved.  Patients with Turcot syndrome (TS) are predisposed to colon tumors and primary brain tumors, typically glioblastomas or medulloblastomas. The authors describe a patient with TS featuring a known germline mutation of exon 5 of the hPMS2 mismatch repair gene who developed two metachronous glioblastomas, both with distinct oligodendroglial features. Because this patient had an unusual underlying condition and his tumor had a unique histological appearance for TS, it was hypothesized that this genetic defect may predispose to malignant gliomas with oligodendroglial features.  Turcot Syndrome caused by APC gene develops medulloblastoma and Turcot Syndrome caused by mismatch repair gene develops glioblastoma.  It is characterized by central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms and gastrointestinal polyposis. Seven months after resection of this Dukes' C2 adenocarcinoma, she presented with a second primary CNS tumor, a glioblastoma multiforme. The Turcot syndrome has been defined as the simultaneous presence of multiple polyposis of the colon and a malignant brain tumor. The case of a 47-year-old man submitted to a right hemicolectomy for cancer and polyposis, following a series of endoscopic polypectomies and, finally, removal of left temporal glioma is here presented.  Two of 13 showed microsatellite instability, one of which in a patient with Turcot syndrome, the other in gliomatosis cerebri. The Turcot syndrome (TS) is a rare, probably autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by development of primary neuroepithelial tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and numerous adenomatous colorectal polyps.  However, no somatic mutations in APC were found among 91 neuroepithelial tumors (medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, astrocytoma, and oligodendroglioma), whether sporadic or associated with TS.  Such syndromes include neurofibromatosis type 2, neurofibromatosis type 1, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, as well as von Hippel-Lindau disease, tuberous sclerosis, and Turcot syndrome.  This patient's case deals with the association between a glioblastoma, anaplastic glioma (WHO Grade III) and colonic adenocarcinoma based on familial polyposis coli.  The authors describe two patients with the association of polyposis-coli and central nervous system tumor (Turcot's syndrome).  We report a case of Turcot's syndrome in a 20-year old man with multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon and glioblastoma multiforme.  Another unusual autopsy case of the Turcot syndrome is reported in a 23-year-old woman with polyposis coli, who developed primary carcinoma of the jejunum and glioblastoma multiforme of the left frontal lobe.  Turcot syndrome represents the unique and discrete occurrence of polyposis coli with glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, or both."	yes

RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a well-characterized DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has also been reported to have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. . Our studies provide compelling evidence that mammalian Pol II acts as an RdRP to control the stability of a cellular RNA by extending its 3'-end. here is, however, evidence that Pol II also possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Pol II can use a homopolymeric RNA template, can extend RNA by several nucleotides in the absence of DNA, and has been implicated in the replication of the RNA genomes of hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and plant viroids. The RdRP activity of Pol II provides a missing link in molecular evolution, because it suggests that Pol II evolved from an ancient replicase that duplicated RNA genomes. The present findings provide a framework for further studies to elucidate the mechanistic principles of transcription by a viral RNA polymerase and have implications for the regulation of Pol II activities in infected cells. Influenza A virus transcribes its segmented negative sense RNA genome in the nuclei of infected cells in a process long known to require host RNA polymerase II (RNAP-II). We conclude that influenza A virus replication requires RNAP-II activity not just to provide capped mRNA substrates but also to facilitate nuclear export of selected viral mRNAs. Thus, influenza virus specifically interferes with Pol II elongation, but not Pol II initiation. We propose that influenza virus RNA polymerase, by binding to the CTD of initiating Pol II and subsequent cleavage of the capped 5' end of the nascent transcript, triggers premature Pol II termination. We show that RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) preinitiation complex recruitment and H3 Lys 4 (H3-K4) methylation at the Xist promoter form the basis of the Xist expression profiles that drives both imprinted and random XCI. Identification of these ENL-associated proteins (EAPs) by mass spectrometry revealed enzymes with a known role in transcriptional elongation (RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase [RNAPolII CTD] positive transcription elongation factor b [pTEFb]), and in chromatin modification (histone-H3 methyltransferase DOT1L) as well as other frequent MLL partners (AF4, AF5q31, and LAF4), and polycomb group members (RING1, CBX8, and BCoR). RNA polymerase II acts as an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to extend and destabilize a non-coding RNA. Association of the influenza A virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase with cellular RNA polymerase II. It is also well established that viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRNP) associates with cellular RNA polymerase II (Pol II), on which viral replication depends.  RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a well-characterized DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which has also been reported to have RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity. Natural cellular RNA substrates of mammalian Pol II, however, have not been identified and the cellular function of the Pol II RdRP activity is unknown.

468	58a337af60087bc10a000016	Is treatment resistant depression related to vitamin B9?	Suboptimal serum and red blood cell folate levels have been associated with a poorer response to antidepressant therapy, a greater severity of symptoms, later onset of clinical improvement, and overall treatment resistance. This article reviews the evidence for L-methylfolate and folic acid as antidepressive agents in depression and discusses their clinical use Although further randomized controlled trials in this area appear warranted, SAMe and L-methylfolate may represent a useful addition to the AD armamentarium. Patients with depression have consistently been found to have lower levels of serum and red blood cell folate than normal or nondepressed psychiatric patients. Decreased folate levels have been associated with lowered response rates to standard antidepressant pharmacotherapy. Recent studies have shown that augmentation with a folate supplement increases medication response in both treatment-naïve and treatment-resistant depressed patients irrespective of whether there is folate deficiency. Depressed patients with both low and normal folate levels may benefit from augmenting a primary antidepressant medication either initially, at the onset of treatment, or later after some degree of treatment resistance has been recognized. The results of this study suggest that intake of vitamin B9 may modulate the total score of Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and two subscales of the CES-D including depressive affect and interpersonal difficulties.

499	587e440f2420191125000005	Does CRISPR inversion of CTCF sites alter genome topology?	CRISPR Inversion of CTCF Sites Alters Genome Topology and Enhancer/Promoter Function To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic-DNA-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and β-globin as model genes. Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. These findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by linear genome sequences CRISPR Inversion of CTCF Sites Alters Genome Topology and Enhancer/Promoter Function.

501	588383172305cd7e21000004	Are there canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes?	Absence of canonical marks of active chromatin in developmentally regulated genes. The interplay of active and repressive histone modifications is assumed to have a key role in the regulation of gene expression. In contrast to this generally accepted view, we show that the transcription of genes temporally regulated during fly and worm development occurs in the absence of canonically active histone modifications. Conversely, strong chromatin marking is related to transcriptional and post-transcriptional stability, an association that we also observe in mammals. Our results support a model in which chromatin marking is associated with the stable production of RNA, whereas unmarked chromatin would permit rapid gene activation and deactivation during development. In the latter case, regulation by transcription factors would have a comparatively more important regulatory role than chromatin marks.

506	5890eb22621ea6ff7e000006	Can Pentraxin 3 predict outcomes of sepsis?	As compared with low serum PTX3and sTWEAK cases, cirrhotic patients with high serum PTX3/sTWEAK levels a have higher probability of new severe infections, severe sepsis, septic shock, type 1 hepatorenal syndrome, in-hospital, and 3-month follow-up mortalities.  Neonates with high nPTX3 concentrations also have lowered APGAR scores, increased rate of respiratory distress syndrome, clinical sepsis, IVH, necrotizing enterocolitis and prolonged NICU stay. In terms of predicting the prognosis of sepsis with heart failure complications, the PTX3 value's area under ROC curve was larger than that of BNP (respectively 0. 844, 0. 472).CONCLUSION: The PTX3 is an objective biochemical marker in diagnosis of sepsis; it is helpful in assessment of severity and prognosis of sepsis; it also has a certain clinical value in the assessment of sepsis cardiovascular function damage. Severe Acinetobacter baumannii sepsis is associated with elevation of pentraxin 3. Together, these results suggest that elevation of PTX3 is associated with fulminant disease during A. baumannii sepsis. Persisting high levels of plasma pentraxin 3 over the first days after severe sepsis and septic shock onset are associated with mortality. PTX3, as a mediator of inflammation, may represent an early marker of severity and outcome in sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Persisting high levels of circulating PTX3 over the first days from sepsis onset may be associated with mortality. PTX3 correlates with severity of sepsis and with sepsis-associated coagulation/fibrinolysis dysfunction. Pentraxin 3 in patients with severe sepsis or shock: the ALBIOS trial.

Redox state of pentraxin 3 as a novel biomarker for resolution of inflammation and survival in sepsis. The prototypic long pentraxin, pentraxin 3, is an acute phase protein that is structurally related but distinct from C-reactive protein which has proven to correlate with the severity of bacterial infection in critically ill patients. Circulating levels of the long pentraxin PTX3 correlate with severity of infection in critically ill patients. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is associated with severe sepsis and fatal disease in emergency room patients with suspected infection: a prospective cohort study. In addition, high levels of PTX3 were associated with unfavorable outcome.CONCLUSIONS: The long pentraxin PTX3 is elevated in critically ill patients and correlates with severity of disease and infection. PTX3, as a mediator of inflammation, may represent an early marker of severity and outcome in sepsis. Redox state of pentraxin 3 as a novel biomarker for resolution of inflammation and survival in sepsis. Persisting high levels of plasma pentraxin 3 over the first days after severe sepsis and septic shock onset are associated with mortality. Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) is associated with severe sepsis and fatal disease in emergency room patients with suspected infection: a prospective cohort study. The proteomic profile of circulating pentraxin 3 (PTX3) complex in sepsis demonstrates the interaction with azurocidin 1 and other components of neutrophil extracellular traps.	yes

But primary cutaneous cryptococcosis (PCC) without systemic infection is rare.  Cryptococcus is a ubiquitous fungus and is known for causing meningitis and cutaneous infections in immunocompromised individuals. Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated yeast that can cause primary pulmonary infections or disseminate and cause infections of the central nervous system, meninges, skin, and bone in the immunocompromised host. The authors report a male patient, a seller with no detected immunosuppression, with an extensive ulcerated skin lesion localized on the left forearm, caused by Cryptococcus neoformans var.	no
527	58e782fd3e8b6dc87c000006	Does GATA-1 regulate ribosomal protein genes?	Mutations in exon 2 interfere with the synthesis of the full-length isoform of GATA-1 and lead to the production of a shortened isoform, GATA-1s. These mutations have been found in patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), a congenital erythroid aplasia typically caused by mutations in genes encoding ribosomal proteins. Sixteen of the corresponding transcription factors are of particular interest, as they are housekeeping genes or show a direct link to hematopoiesis, tumorigenesis or leukemia (e.g. GATA-1/2, PU.1, MZF-1). Deletion of PKC1 relieves the repression of both ribosomal protein and rRNA genes that occurs in response to a defect in the secretory pathway. This stress is monitored by Pkc1p, which initiates a signal transduction pathway that leads to repression of transcription of the rRNA and ribosomal protein genes. The importance of the transcription of the 137 ribosomal protein genes to the economy of the cell is apparent from the existence of at least three distinct pathways that can effect the repression of this set of genes.	yes

553	58965a4178275d0c4a00000e	Is there any involvement of L1 retrotransposition in the Rett syndrome?	Using neuronal progenitor cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells and human tissues, we revealed that patients with Rett syndrome (RTT), carrying MeCP2 mutations, have increased susceptibility for L1 retrotransposition. Our data demonstrate that L1 retrotransposition can be controlled in a tissue-specific manner and that disease-related genetic mutations can influence the frequency of neuronal L1 retrotransposition. Our findings add a new level of complexity to the molecular events that can lead to neurological disorders. Furthermore, some neurological diseases, such as Rett syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia, misregulate L1 retrotransposition, which could contribute to some pathological aspects.  Recent studies indicate that long interspersed nuclear element-1 (L1) are mobilized in the genome of human neural progenitor cells and enhanced in Rett syndrome and ataxia telangiectasia.  In addition, recent data indicate that engineered human L1s can undergo somatic retrotransposition in human neural progenitor cells and that an increase in human-specific L1 DNA content can be detected in the brains of normal controls, as well as in Rett syndrome patients.

557	58965ed478275d0c4a000010	Is there any role of TBR1 in autism?	TBR1 regulates autism risk genes in the developing neocortex Exome sequencing studies have identified multiple genes harboring de novo loss-of-function (LoF) variants in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), including TBR1, a master regulator of cortical development. We performed ChIP-seq for TBR1 during mouse cortical neurogenesis and show that TBR1-bound regions are enriched adjacent to ASD genes. ASD genes were also enriched among genes that are differentially expressed in Tbr1 knockouts, which together with the ChIP-seq data, suggests direct transcriptional regulation. Of the nine ASD genes examined, seven were misexpressed in the cortices of Tbr1 knockout mice, including six with increased expression in the deep cortical layers. ASD genes with adjacent cortical TBR1 ChIP-seq peaks also showed unusually low levels of LoF mutations in a reference human population and among Icelanders. We then leveraged TBR1 binding to identify an appealing subset of candidate ASD genes. Our findings highlight a TBR1-regulated network of ASD genes in the developing neocortex that are relatively intolerant to LoF mutations, indicating that these genes may play critical roles in normal cortical development. T-Brain-1--A Potential Master Regulator in Autism Spectrum Disorders. T-Brain-1 (TBR1), a causative gene in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), encodes a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. It is therefore possible that TBR1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors. The downstream genes of TBR1 have been identified using microarray and promoter analyses. In this study, we annotated individual genes downstream of TBR1 and investigated any associations with ASDs through extensive literature searches. Of 124 TBR1 target genes, 23 were reported to be associated with ASDs. Among these 24 genes, four transcription factors Auts2, Nfia, Nr4a2, and Sox5 were found, suggesting that TBR1 controls a transcriptional cascade relevant to autism pathogenesis. A further five of the 24 genes (Cd44, Cdh8, Cntn6, Gpc6, and Ntng1) encode membrane proteins that regulate cell adhesion and axonal outgrowth. These genes likely contribute to the role of TBR1 in regulation of neuronal migration and axonal extension. Besides, decreases in Grin2b expression and increases in Gad1 expression imply that neuronal activity may be aberrant in Tbr1 deficient mice. These analyses provide direction for future experiments to reveal the pathogenic mechanism of autism. The activity-regulated gene expression of transcription factors is required for neural plasticity and function in response to neuronal stimulation. T-brain-1 (TBR1), a critical neuron-specific transcription factor for forebrain development, has been recognized as a high-confidence risk gene for autism spectrum disorders.  Disruptive mutations in the TBR1 gene have been repeatedly identified in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).  Next-generation sequencing recently revealed that recurrent disruptive mutations in a few genes may account for 1% of sporadic autism cases. Coupling these novel genetic data to empirical assays of protein function can illuminate crucial molecular networks. Here we demonstrate the power of the approach, performing the first functional analyses of TBR1 variants identified in sporadic autism. T-brain-1 (TBR1) is a brain-specific T-box transcription factor. In 1995, Tbr1 was first identified from a subtractive hybridization that compared mouse embryonic and adult telencephalons. Previous studies of Tbr1 (-∕-) mice have indicated critical roles for TBR1 in the development of the cerebral cortex, amygdala, and olfactory bulb. Neuronal migration and axonal projection are two important developmental features controlled by TBR1. Recently, recurrent de novo disruptive mutations in the TBR1 gene have been found in patients with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Human genetic studies have identified TBR1 as a high-confidence risk factor for ASDs. TBR1 regulates autism risk genes in the developing neocortex. De novo TBR1 mutations in sporadic autism disrupt protein functions. In humans, PAX6, EOMES, and TBR1 have been linked to intellectual disability and autism. It is therefore possible that TBR1 controls the expression of other autism risk factors. Neuronal excitation upregulates Tbr1, a high-confidence risk gene of autism, mediating Grin2b expression in the adult brain.

562	5a68f2bab750ff4455000017	Is tretinoin effective for photoaging?	"Background. Tretinoin has been shown to improve photoaged skin. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a 5% retinoic acid peel combined with microdermabrasion for facial photoaging. .Conclusion. This study demonstrated that 5% retinoic acid peel cream combined with microdermabrasion was safe and effective in the treatment of photoaging in the Iranian population.  CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with a double-conjugate retinoid cream demonstrated early reductions in photodamage and improvements in Hydration. AHA-Ret induced less Erythema vs retinol and was more tolerable vs retinol and tretinoin. These comparative products include prescription tretinoin, physician strength idebenone, kinetin, polyhydroxy, lactic and glycolic acids in reversing signs of photoaging. CONCLUSION: Either topical tretinoin (0.25%) or retinol (0.25%) can be used safely and effectively when applied in office immediately after SA peeling to ameliorate signs of photoaging. CONCLUSION: The treatment outcome of Retinol 0.2%/LR2412 2% cream does not differ from the one of tretinoin 0.025% cream. Clinical results were not statistically different.  INTRODUCTION: Topical tretinoin is considered the gold standard to treat photoaged skin, but it is associated with side effects and only available upon prescription. Tretinoin is commonly used topically for acne treatment and in the treatment of photoaging. BACKGROUND: Topical tretinoin is effective treatment for both acne and photoaging. The efficacy of tretinoin is well established in the treatment of acne and photoaged skin, however as a typical side effect of tretinoin treatment most patients develop a low-grade irritant dermatitis. Topical tretinoin is established as an effective treatment for photoaging. BACKGROUND Topical tretinoin is effective treatment for both acne and photoaging. Tretinoin is the only pharmacologic compound shown to partially reverse some signs of photoaging. Although once considered an irreversible process, it is now established that photoaging can be treated by topical tretinoin. Moreover, studies that have elucidated photoaging pathophysiology have produced significant evidence that topical tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid), the only agent approved so far for the treatment of photoaging, also works to prevent it. BACKGROUND AND DESIGN The efficacy of topical tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) in treating photoaging is well established. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS Tretinoin can be used for photoaging treatment or combined treatment by different mechanisms. Tretinoin is still the best tested retinoid to reverse photoaged skin. The separation between clinical improvement and irritation suggests that mechanisms other than irritation dominate tretinoin-induced repair of photoaging in humans. * A cream containing 0.05% tretinoin (Retinova((R)) is approved for treatment of sun-induced skin damage (""photoaging""). Randomized, controlled trials have shown that topical tretinoin is effective in the treatment of photoaged skin. Tretinoin has been shown to improve photoaged skin. Topical tretinoin is effective treatment for both acne and photoaging. Randomized, controlled trials have shown that topical tretinoin is effective in the treatment of photoaged skin..

574	5a774ce1faa1ab7d2e000006	Is there increased recombination rate in human regulatory domains?	"Evidence of reduced recombination rate in human regulatory domains. We study the relationship between recombination rate and gene regulatory domains, defined by a gene and its linked control elements. We define these links using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs), chromatin conformation from publicly available datasets (Hi-C and ChIA-PET), and correlated activity links that we infer across cell types. Each link type shows a ""recombination rate valley"" of significantly reduced recombination rate compared to matched control regions. This recombination rate valley is most pronounced for gene regulatory domains of early embryonic development genes, housekeeping genes, and constitutive regulatory elements, which are known to show increased evolutionary constraint across species. Recombination rate valleys show increased DNA methylation, reduced doublestranded break initiation, and increased repair efficiency, specifically in the lineage leading to the germ line. Moreover, by using only the overlap of functional links and DNA methylation in germ cells, we are able to predict the recombination rate with high accuracy.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest the existence of a recombination rate valley at regulatory domains and provide a potential molecular mechanism to interpret the interplay between genetic and epigenetic variations."	no
575	5a7612b483b0d9ea6600001d	Is enzastaurin effective treatment of glioblastoma?	RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056).  Enzastaurin (LY317615) in combination with bevacizumab for recurrent malignant gliomas is well-tolerated, with response and progression-free survival similar to bevacizumab monotherapy. So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis nor at recurrent disease. Despite promising phase II clinical trial results and patient benefit in terms of clinical improvement and longer progression-free survival, an overall survival benefit has not been demonstrated in four randomized phase III trials of bevacizumab or cilengitide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma or cediranib or enzastaurin in recurrent glioblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: PFS-6 missed the primary planned outcome of 55%.  OS (median, 74 weeks) and PFS (median, 36 weeks) results from the current trial were comparable to those from a prior phase II study using erlotinib and were significantly better than those from 2 other previous studies that used thalidomide or cis-retinoic acid, all in combination with temozolomide plus RT.  More recently, antiangiogenic agents including enzastaurin, cediranib, bevacizumab, and others that target mainly the VEGF pathway, have been evaluated in this highly angiogenic disease. Among them, only bevacizumab has been associated with clear anti-tumor activity, although the lack of control studies limits the impact of the results to date. Enzastaurin has anti-glioma activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, but does not appear to have enough single-agent activity to be useful as monotherapy. Several signal transduction inhibitors have been examined in preclinical and clinical malignant glioma trials, including antiangiogenic agents (bevacizumab, enzastaurin), and inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (temsirolimus, everolimus) and integrin (cilengitide). Although preliminary clinical results of the use of targeted agents have not translated into significantly better survival, more recent phase II trials are exploring the combination of multitargeted drugs with cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to overcome the resistance of tumors to single-agent targeted therapies. Several drugs have been tested, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (temsirolimus and everolimus), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), protein kinase C-beta, and other angiogenesis pathways inhibitors (vatalanib, bevacizumab, and enzastaurin). Although preliminary efficacy results of most trials in recurrent disease have fallen short on expectations, substantial advances have been achieved by associated translational research.  So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis nor at recurrent disease.	no

597	5a89537cfcd1d6a10c000002	Are mouse chromosomes acrocentric?	 Based on combined fluorescence in situ hybridization and linkage mapping, the gene order on CFA9 is similar to that of the homologous genes on HSA17q and mouse chromosome 11 (MMU11), but in the dog the gene order is inverted with respect to the centromere.  In murine models of human carcinogenesis, however, karyotype analysis is technically demanding because mouse chromosomes are acrocentric and of similar size. The minor satellite is closer to the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes than the major satellite  These cells contain Robertsonian translocated chromosomes 1 and 7 as the only submetacentric chromosome in an otherwise acrocentric genome.  The resulting metacentric chromosomes are very different in size and in morphology from normal mouse acrocentric chromosomes.  Because of 35 independent primary hybrids used in this study were derived from two types of feral mice, each with a different combination of Robertsonian translocation chromosomes, as well as from mice with a normal complement of acrocentric chromosomes, analysis of 16 selected mouse enzyme markers provided data on the segregation of all 20 mouse chromosomes in these hybrids The two mouse stocks exhibit karyotypes consisting of nine pairs of metacentric chromosomes as a result of centric fusions of acrocentric chromosomes in different combinations. Physical gene mapping by in situ hybridization is a difficult task in an all-acrocentric mouse karyotype, because all of the chromosomes are morphologically very similar. The resulting metacentric chromosomes are very different in size and in morphology from normal mouse acrocentric chromosomes. murine models of human carcinogenesis are exceedingly valuable tools to understand genetic mechanisms of neoplastic growth the identification of recurrent chromosomal rearrangements by cytogenetic techniques serves as an initial screening test for tumour specific aberrations in murine models of human carcinogenesis however karyotype analysis is technically demanding because mouse chromosomes are acrocentric and of similar size fluorescence in situ hybridization fish with mouse chromosome specific painting probes can complement conventional banding analysis although sensitive and specific fish analyses are restricted to the visualization of only a few mouse chromosomes at a time here we apply a novel imaging technique that we developed recently for the visualization of human chromosomes to the simultaneous discernment of all mouse chromosomes the approach is based on spectral imaging to measure chromosome specific spectra after fish with differentially labelled mouse chromosome painting probes utilizing a combination of fourier spectroscopy ccd imaging and conventional optical microscopy spectral imaging allows simultaneous measurement of the fluorescence emission spectrum at all sample points a spectrum based classification algorithm has been adapted to karyotype mouse chromosomes we have applied spectral karyotyping sky to chemically induced plasmocytomas mammary gland tumours from transgenic mice overexpressing the c myc oncogene and thymomas from mice deficient for the ataxia telangiectasia atm gene results from these analyses demonstrate the potential of sky to identify complex chromosomal aberrations in mouse models of human carcinogenesis.	yes

Repair of the mitral valve in children who have Marfan syndrome is especially difficult due to the presence of generalized connective tissue disorder, which may lead to future elongation and rupture of chordae tendineae that were unaffected at the time of mitral valve repair. Mitral regurgitation was caused by annulus dilatation in all patients, by leaflet prolapse in five patients, and by chordal rupture due to endocarditis in two.  Perioperative coronary artery spasm in modified Bentall's operation for annulo-aortic ectasia in Marfan's syndrome. A case report of perioperative chordal rupture of the mitral valve. In a modified Bentall's operation (button technique), perioperative severe coronary artery spasm occurred in spite of the preventive use of nitroglycerin infusion, which resulted in profound ventricular fibrillation and subsequent chordal rupture of the mitral valve with Sellers IV regurgitation. It is worthy to report this case because of rarities such as Marfan's syndrome accompanied by Prinzmetal's variant angina, perioperative coronary artery spasm in modified Bentall's operation, and perioperative chordal rupture of the mitral valve and progression of mitral valve regurgitation.

Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a fatal complication of measles. We reviewed California cases from 1998-2015 to understand risk f Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis should be eliminated by measles vaccination The mean interval between measles infection and onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis was 6.5 years (range = 3-11 years). Active surveillance of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis for those with measles infection during the 1988 outbreak is necessary to conduct multicenter drug trials for this devastating disease.<br> There has been an increasing trend of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in southern China after the measles outbreak in 1988. The prevalence rate of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in Hong Kong and Macau in 2002 was 1 per million total population or 5.5 per million children. Because a positive correlation was found between the prevalence of measles and the onset of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, particularly among children infected at an early age, it is vital to eradicate measles infection by vaccination.<br> Incidence of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis following measles and measles vaccination in Japan. UNLABELLED Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), in the majority of cases, is caused by the wild measles virus, although there are some reports relating SSPE to vaccination. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by the measles (rubeola) virus and is most often seen in children. There was no indication that measles vaccine can induce SSPE. Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare lethal disease of children and young adults due to persistence of measles virus (MeV) in the brain, is caused by wild type (wt) MeV. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a progressive neurological disorder of childhood and early adolescence caused by persistent defective measles virus. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a devastating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by persistent mutant measles virus infection. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) caused by persistent defective measles virus strains, is a progressive neurological disorder of children and adolescents. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), in the majority of cases, is caused by the wild measles virus, although there are some reports relating SSPE to vaccination. Measles can persist in the central nervous system and cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a progressive disease that is almost always fatal. However, because of the median 8-year interval between measles and onset of SSPE, The prevention of endemic circulation of measles virus in England and Wales through the high coverage achieved with MMR vaccine, together with the measles/rubella vaccination campaign of 1994, has resulted in the near elimination of SSPE. We applied the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the measles virus genome in specimens from a 12-year-old boy with SSPE who had received measles vaccine 10 years before and had no history of apparent natural measles. The oligonucleotide primers for PCR were prepared based on the nucleotide sequence of the F and NP genes of the measles virus Edmonston strain.RESULTS: F and NP genes were detected in both the cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence analysis of the F gene showed that the patient's virus was different from that of the vaccine strain. Judging from these results, it was likely that the SSPE-associated strain in this case was derived from the wild-type rather than the vaccine strain subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a late, rare and usually fatal complication of measles infection. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a chronic central nervous (CNS) system infection caused by measles virus  Epidemiological and virological data suggest that measles vaccine does not cause SSPE. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a rare, progressive, fatal central nervous system disease of children, is caused by measles virus. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a form of chronic persistent measles encephalitis in childhood which rarely manifests after wild virus infection. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is a fatal infectious disease of childhood caused by persistence of the measles virus in the brain.  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a fatal encephalitis manifesting a number of years after a primary measles infection.  Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a fatal complication of measles infection. In 2015, the Oregon Health Authority was notified of the death of a boy with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare and fatal complication of measles. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare progressive neurological disorder of early adolescence caused by persistent infection of the measles virus, which remains prevalent worldwide despite an effective vaccine.  Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) is a debilitating disorder associated with the measles infection in childhood.	no
641	5a991ee21d1251d03b000005	Are there sex differences in the transcriptome of the mouse hippocampus?	To better understand the possible molecular basis for the sex-biased nature of neurological disorders, we used a developmental series of female and male mice at 1, 2, and 4 months of age to assess both mRNA and protein in the hippocampus with RNA-sequencing and mass-spectrometry, respectively. The bulk of these differentially expressed genes are changed in both sexes at one or more ages, but a total of 198 transcripts are differentially expressed between females and males at one or more ages. The number of transcripts that are differentially expressed between females and males is greater in adult animals than in younger animals. Additionally, we identify 69 transcripts that show complex and sex-specific patterns of temporal regulation through postnatal development, 8 of which are heat-shock proteins.  Additionally, this analysis reveals sex differences in the transcriptome of the developing mouse hippocampus, and further clarifies the need to include both female and male mice in longitudinal studies involving molecular changes in the hippocampus.	yes
659	5abc974bfcf456587200001f	Is recursive splicing more common in short introns?	"Recent work in human and fruitfly tissues revealed that long introns are extensively processed cotranscriptionally and in a stepwise manner, before their two flanking exons are spliced together Cutting a Long Intron Short: Recursive Splicing and Its Implications.  Furthermore, we uncover the potential to investigate the multi-step nature of splicing, assessing various types of recursive splicing events Recursive splicing is a process in which large introns are removed in multiple steps by re-splicing at ratchet points--5' splice sites recreated after splicing. Together, these results indicate that recursive splicing is commonly used in Drosophila, occurs in humans, and provides insight into the mechanisms by which some large introns are removed. Recursive splicing in long vertebrate genes. Moreover, the RS-sites are found in some of the longest introns across vertebrates.  The peculiarities of large intron splicing in animals. These ""large introns"" must be spliced out of the pre-mRNA in a timely fashion, which involves bringing together distant 5' and 3' acceptor and donor splice sites. Using a computational analysis of the genomic sequences, we show that vertebrates lack the proper enrichment of RP-sites in their large introns, and, therefore, require some other method to aid splicing Subdivision of large introns in Drosophila by recursive splicing at nonexonic elements. Recursive splice sites predicted with highly stringent criteria are found at much higher frequency than expected in the sense strands of introns>20 kb, but they are found only at the expected frequency on the antisense strands, and they are underrepresented within introns<10 kb. These transcripts arise by use of two alternative transcription sites and complex alternative splicing mechanisms and encode proteins with long or short N-terminal domains, complete or incomplete GGL domains, 7 distinct C-terminal domains and a common internal domain where the RGS domain is found. These patterns of enrichment and conservation indicate that recursive splice sites are advantageous in the context of long introns. Many genes with important roles in development and disease contain exceptionally long introns, but special mechanisms for their expression have not been investigated. However, some long Drosophila melanogaster introns contain a cryptic site, known as a recursive splice site (RS-site), that enables a multi-step process of intron removal termed recursive splicing. The effect of splice site strength was context-dependent and much more significant for the 3' splice site of the longer alternative intron than for the 3' splice site of the shorter alternative intron and the common 5' splice sites; it was also more significant in the rat minigene than in the mouse minigene.

0	553a8d78f321868558000003	Are ultraconserved elements often transcribed?	Starting from a genome-wide expression profiling, we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the modulation of long noncoding transcripts from ultraconserved regions, termed transcribed-ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) Our data gives a first glimpse of a novel functional hypoxic network comprising protein-coding transcripts and noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) from the T-UCRs category Highly conserved elements discovered in vertebrates are present in non-syntenic loci of tunicates, act as enhancers and can be transcribed during development The majority of these regions map onto ultraconserved elements and we demonstrate that they can act as functional enhancers within the organism of origin, as well as in cross-transgenesis experiments, and that they are transcribed in extant species of Olfactores. We refer to the elements as 'Olfactores conserved non-coding elements' We used a custom microarray to assess the levels of UCE transcription during mouse development and integrated these data with published microarray and next-generation sequencing datasets as well as with newly produced PCR validation experiments. We show that a large fraction of non-exonic UCEs is transcribed across all developmental stages examined from only one DNA strand. Although the nature of these transcripts remains a mistery, our meta-analysis of RNA-Seq datasets indicates that they are unlikely to be short RNAs and that some of them might encode nuclear transcripts Our data shows that the concurrent presence of enhancer and transcript function in non-exonic UCE elements is more widespread than previously shown. Moreover through our own experiments as well as the use of next-generation sequencing datasets, we were able to show that the RNAs encoded by non-exonic UCEs are likely to be long RNAs transcribed from only one DNA strand Short ultraconserved promoter regions delineate a class of preferentially expressed alternatively spliced transcripts The importance of other classes of non-coding RNAs, such as long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) and transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) as altered elements in neoplasia, is also gaining recognition. Other ncRNAs, such as PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) and large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as key elements of cellular homeostasis. The majority of these regions map onto ultraconserved elements and we demonstrate that they can act as functional enhancers within the organism of origin, as well as in cross-transgenesis experiments, and that they are transcribed in extant species of Olfactores. Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a subset of 481 sequences longer than 200 bp, which are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of human, rat and mouse genomes, and are actively transcribed. Highly conserved elements discovered in vertebrates are present in non-syntenic loci of tunicates, act as enhancers and can be transcribed during development. The Evf-2 noncoding RNA is transcribed from the Dlx-5/6 ultraconserved region and functions as a Dlx-2 transcriptional coactivator. In this report, we show that the Dlx-5/6 ultraconserved region is transcribed to generate an alternatively spliced form of Evf-1, the ncRNA Evf-2. These studies identify a critical role for TUC338 in regulation of transformed cell growth and of transcribed ultraconserved ncRNA as a unique class of genes involved in the pathobiology of HCC. Transcribed ultraconserved region (T-UCR) transcripts are a novel class of lncRNAs transcribed from ultraconserved regions (UCRs) The majority of these regions map onto ultraconserved elements and we demonstrate that they can act as functional enhancers within the organism of origin, as well as in cross-transgenesis experiments, and that they are transcribed in extant species of Olfactores Transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) are a subset of 481 sequences longer than 200 bp, which are absolutely conserved between orthologous regions of human, rat and mouse genomes, and are actively transcribed Other ncRNAs, such as PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), transcribed ultraconserved regions (T-UCRs) and large intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as key elements of cellular homeostasis Transcribed ultraconserved region in human cancers. We show that a large fraction of non-exonic UCEs is transcribed across all developmental stages examined from only one DNA strand Although uc.338 is partially located within the poly(rC) binding protein 2 (PCBP2) gene, the transcribed ncRNA encoding uc.338 is expressed independently of PCBP2 and was cloned as a 590-bp RNA gene, termed TUC338 Moreover through our own experiments as well as the use of next-generation sequencing datasets, we were able to show that the RNAs encoded by non-exonic UCEs are likely to be long RNAs transcribed from only one DNA strand.	yes
4	56c9e9d15795f9a73e00001d	Is exonuclease Xrn1 a component of the P-bodies?	"PBs are associated with mRNA decay and contain the decapping enzymes DCP1/2, the 5' to 3' exonuclease Xrn1, the Lsm proteins (1-7), and the scaffolding proteins hedls/GE-1 and GW182. Both SGs and PBs contain mRNA, eIF4E, microRNAs and argonaute proteins, and various regulators of mRNA stability and translation (TTP, RCK/p54, and CPEB). An alternative pathway of mRNA degradation occurs at processing bodies, cytoplasmic foci that contain decapping enzymes, the 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn1 and the Lsm1-7 heptamer.  n eukaryotic cells degradation of bulk mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction requires the consecutive action of the decapping complex (consisting of DCP1 and DCP2) and the 5' to 3' exonuclease XRN1. These enzymes are found in discrete cytoplasmic foci known as P-bodies or GW-bodies (because of the accumulation of the GW182 antigen). Several proteins that stimulate mRNA decapping by the Dcp1:Dcp2 complex co-localize with Dcp1 and Dcp2, together with Xrn1, a 5'-to-3' exonuclease, to structures in the cytoplasm called processing bodies.   On the other hand, many P-body components including LSM1, GW182, DDX3, DDX6 and XRN1, but not others like DCP1a and EDC4 are recruited to the viral replication sites, as evidenced by their colocalization at perinuclear region with viral NS3. We identified the Pab 1801 cytoplasmic puncta as P Bodies (PBs), which are involved in mRNA regulation. We found that, in several cell lines, including U2OS, WI38, SK-N-SH and HCT116, the Pab 1801 puncta strictly colocalize with PBs identified with specific antibodies against the PB components Hedls, Dcp1a, Xrn1 or Rck/p54. The core components of P-bodies, including the decapping machinery (Dcp2 and Dhh1), 5'-3' exoribonuclease (Kem1/Xrn1), and the P-body scaffolding protein (Edc3), were identified and their localizations with respect to P-bodies were demonstrated. The second type of granules, piP-bodies, harbors the MIWI2-TDRD9-MAEL module of the piRNA pathway and signature components of P-bodies, GW182, DCP1a, DDX6/p54, and XRN1 proteins. In yeast and human tissue culture cells, Xrn1 has been shown to be a component of P-bodies (processing bodies), dynamic cytoplasmic granules where RNA degradation can take place. Here, we show that staufen- and FMRP-containing RNPs in Drosophila neurons contain proteins also present in somatic ""P bodies,"" including the RNA-degradative enzymes Dcp1p and Xrn1p/Pacman and crucial components of miRNA (argonaute), NMD (Upf1p), and general translational repression (Dhh1p/Me31B) pathways.  In eukaryotic cells, XRN1 is often found in particles known as processing bodies (P bodies) together with other proteins involved in the 5' → 3' degradation pathway, such as DCP2 and the helicase DHH1 (Me31B).  In yeast and human tissue culture cells, Xrn1 has been shown to be a component of P-bodies (processing bodies), dynamic cytoplasmic granules where RNA degradation can take place Owing to the essential functions of P bodies in mRNA regulation, we explored computationally the functional significance of SNPs in 7 P body components such as XRN1, DCP2, EDC3, CPEB1, GEMIN5, STAU1 and TRIM71 The core components of P-bodies, including the decapping machinery (Dcp2 and Dhh1), 5&apos;-3&apos; exoribonuclease (Kem1/Xrn1), and the P-body scaffolding protein (Edc3), were identified and their localizations with respect to P-bodies were demonstrated Here, we show that staufen- and FMRP-containing RNPs in Drosophila neurons contain proteins also present in somatic &quot;P bodies,&quot; including the RNA-degradative enzymes Dcp1p and Xrn1p/Pacman and crucial components of miRNA (argonaute), NMD (Upf1p), and general translational repression (Dhh1p/Me31B) pathways P-body components LSM1, GW182, DDX3, DDX6 and XRN1 are recruited to WNV replication sites and positively regulate viral replication. The core components of P-bodies, including the decapping machinery (Dcp2 and Dhh1), 5&apos;-3&apos; exoribonuclease (Kem1/Xrn1), and the P-body scaffolding protein (Edc3), were identified and their localizations with respect to P-bodies were demonstrated. Various growth conditions, including glucose deprivation, hyperosmotic stress, and heat stress, stimulated the accumulation of P-bodies. Here we show that microscopically visible P-bodies are greatly diminished following West Nile viral infection, but the component proteins are not depleted. On the other hand, many P-body components including LSM1, GW182, DDX3, DDX6 and XRN1, but not others like DCP1a and EDC4 are recruited to the viral replication sites, as evidenced by their colocalization at perinuclear region with viral NS3. Owing to the essential functions of P bodies in mRNA regulation, we explored computationally the functional significance of SNPs in 7 P body components such as XRN1, DCP2, EDC3, CPEB1, GEMIN5, STAU1 and TRIM71. Computational analyses of non-synonymous SNPs of these components was initiated using well utilized publicly available software programs such as the SIFT, followed by PolyPhen, PANTHER, MutPred, I-Mutant-2. Xrn1 has been shown to be a component of P-bodies (processing bodies), Here, we show that hDIS3L2 is an exosome-independent cytoplasmic mRNA 3'-5' exonuclease, which exhibits processive activity on structured RNA substrates in vitro. hDIS3L2 associates with hXRN1 in an RNA-dependent manner and can, like hXRN1, be found on polysomes Inhibition of TAK1-JNK signaling also affected the number and size of P bodies and the localization of DCP1a, Xrn1, and Edc4.  The organizing mechanism that forms P body foci in cells is unknown; however, potential scaffolding, aggregating, or other regulatory proteins found in P bodies were investigated for degradation. Two factors involved in 5'-end mRNA decapping and degradation, Xrn1 and Dcp1a, and the 3' deadenylase complex component Pan3 underwent accelerated degradation during infection, and Dcp1a may be a direct substrate of PV 3C proteinase. Secondly, P-bodies recruit mRNAs that are targeted for deadenylation and degradation by the decapping/Xrn1 pathway.  Depletion of TRN increased the number of P-bodies and stabilized ARE-containing mRNAs, as observed with knockdown of the 5'-3' exonuclease Xrn1. In this paper we show for the first time that Pacman, the Drosophila homologue of Xrn1, is localized in cytoplasmic particles in Drosophila testis cells.  Depletion of TRN increased the number of P-bodies and stabilized ARE-containing mRNAs, as observed with knockdown of the 5&apos;-3&apos; exonuclease Xrn1 These structures stain positively for a number of P-body and microRNP components, a microRNA-repressed mRNA and some translational repressors. They appear more heterogeneous than P-bodies of HeLa cells, and they rarely contain the exonuclease Xrn1 but are positive for rRNA."	yes
25	5509ec41c2af5d5b70000006	Is HER2 active only when it dimerizes?	HER activation is driven by the formation of various dimer complexes between members of this receptor family. rtuzumab is the first humanized monoclonal antibody in a new class of drugs, the HER dimerization inhibitors, approved by the Food and Drug Pertuzumab is a novel anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, which blocks HER2 dimerization with other ligand-activated HER family members. Here, we explored the complement-mediated anti-tumor effects of trastuzumab and pertuzumab on HER2-positive tumor cells of various histological origins. ays. In this study, we report that an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (HER2Mab), which blocks HER2 dimerization with HER3, induces HER3 dimerization with EGFR in both low and high HER2 expressing cancer cells. Recent evidence from both basic and clinical studies suggests that ERBB3 (HER3) serves as a key activator of downstream signaling through dimerization with other ERBB proteins and plays a critical role in the widespread clinical resistance to EGFR and HER2 targeting cancer therapies.  HER3 intracellular domains play a crucial role in HER3/HER2 dimerization and activation of downstream signaling pathways. Dimerization among the EGFR family of tyrosine kinase receptors leads to allosteric activation of the kinase domains of the partners. Our results show that quantification of HER dimerization provides information about receptor activation that cannot be obtained by quantification of single receptors.  Pertuzumab is a novel humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) dimerization. It was recently approved by the US FDA for use in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have not received prior anti-HER2 therapy or chemotherapy for metastatic disease.  he HER dimerization status may be more important than HER receptor expression per se in determining sensitivity or resistance to a given therapeutic agen  and HER2 dimerization inhibitors One of the mechanisms by which tumor cell proliferation can be inhibited consists in hampering HER2 dimerization by targeting its extracellular domain with specific antibodies.  Pertuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, is the first HER2 dimerization inhibitor. It binds to the dimerization site on the HER2 domain and prevents ligand-driven pairing of HER2 with other HER receptors, thus inhibiting tumor cell growth and survival Pertuzumab, another monoclonal antibody, is a HER2 dimerization inhibitor that binds to a different epitope on HER2 than trastuzumab and inhibits HER2 dimer formation with other HER family members such as HER3 and HER1. 	yes

68	5a70ec6899e2c3af2600000c	Is pregabalin effective for sciatica?	CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with pregabalin did not significantly reduce the intensity of leg pain associated with sciatica and did not significantly improve other outcomes, as compared with placebo, over the course of 8 weeks. The incidence of adverse events was significantly higher in the pregabalin group than in the placebo group.  Whilst pregabalin (PGB) and gabapentin (GBP) are both used to treat neuropathic pain, their relative role in sciatica is unclear. GBP and PGB appeared to demonstrate comparable efficacy and SE. However, the amount and quality of evidence was low, and only indirect comparisons were available. 	no
