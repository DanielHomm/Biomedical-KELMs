11	54fefff26ad7dcbc1200000b	Are there web based self management strategies for chronic pain ?	Fibromyalgia Symptom Reduction by Online Behavioral Self-monitoring,  This study aimed to evaluate effects of a web-based, self-monitoring and symptom management system (SMARTLog) that analyzes personal self-monitoring data and delivers data-based feedback over time. Moderate use (3 times weekly x 3 months) increased likelihood of clinically significant improvements in pain, memory, gastrointestinal problems, depression, fatigue, and concentration; heavy use (4.5 times weekly x five months) produced the above plus improvement in stiffness and sleep difficulties. Results suggest that the tailored online chronic pain management program showed promising effects on pain at 1 and 6 months posttreatment and quality of life at 6 months posttreatment in this naturalistic study. Results suggest the potential value of self-management for chronic pain patients and the potential acceptability of web-based delivery of intervention content. Patient involvement can be fostered by web-based applications combining health information with decision support or behaviour change support. These so-called Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs) can reach great numbers of patients at low financial cost and provide information and support at the time, place and learning speed patients prefer. Web-based interventions may also be effective in enhancing self-management for individuals with chronic pain, but little is known about long-term effects. Research on Web-based interventions to support self-management following participation in pain management programs is limited. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to examine the long-term effects of a 4-week smartphone-intervention 	yes
41	54f4703764850a5854000008	Does MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) contribute to cardiovascular disease?	The synergistic effect of miR-21 and miR-1 were functionally validated for their significant influences on myocardial apoptosis, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Taken together, we found a novel reciprocal loop between miR-21 and TGFβRIII in cardiac fibrosis caused by myocardial infarction in mice, and targeting this pathway could be a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of myocardial remodeling. It is still controversial whether microRNA-21 (miR-21) participates in the process of cardiac fibrosis. In mice, myocardial miR-21 overexpression is related to cardiac fibrosis elicited by pressure overload.  The myocardial and plasma levels of miR-21 were significantly higher in the AS patients compared with the controls and correlated directly with the echocardiographic mean transvalvular gradients. Our results support the role of miR-21 as a regulator of the fibrotic process that occurs in response to pressure overload in AS patients and underscore the value of circulating miR-21 as a biomarker for myocardial fibrosis. Ad-miR-21 improves LV remodeling and decreases the apoptosis of myocardial cells, suggesting the possible mechanism by which Ad-miR-21 functions in protecting against I/R injury. In the Ad-miR-21 group, LV dimensions, myocardial infarct size, LV/BW, collagen type Ⅰ, type Ⅲ and PCNA positive cells all significantly decreased compared with the Ad-GFP group. While miR-21, -133, -150, -195, and -214 regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, miR-1/-133 and miR-208 have been elucidated to influence myocardial contractile function. In addition, miR-21, -24, -133, -210, -494, and -499 appear to protect myocytes against I/R-induced apoptosis, whereas miR-1, -29, -199a, and -320 promote apoptosis. Myocardial fibrosis can be regulated by the miR-29 family and miR-21. The small regulatory RNA microRNA-21 (miR-21) plays a crucial role in a plethora of biological functions and diseases including development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases and inflammation. During recent years, additional roles of miR-21 in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, including cardiac and pulmonary fibrosis as well as myocardial infarction have been described. On the other hand, miR-21, miR-199a, miR-210, and miR-494 have been proven critical for the myocytes' adaptation and survival during hypoxia/ischemia.  Studies have shown that several miRs, including miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-126, miR-320, miR-92a, and miR-199a, are regulated after preconditioning and play an active role in protecting the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury. Studies using various in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro models have suggested the possible involvement of miR-1, miR-21, miR-29, miR-92a, miR-133, miR-199a, and miR-320 in ischemia-reperfusion injury and/or remodeling after myocardial infarction. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system. Recent studies have revealed that its expression is deregulated in heart and vasculature under cardiovascular disease conditions such as proliferative vascular disease, cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. miR-21 is found to play important roles in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and apoptosis, cardiac cell growth and death, and cardiac fibroblast functions. Accordingly, miR-21 is proven to be involved in the pathogenesis of the above-mentioned cardiovascular diseases as demonstrated by both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. miR-21 might be a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases. This review article summarizes the research progress regarding the roles of miR-21 in cardiovascular disease. Remarkably, miR-21 was one of most upregulated miRNAs in hearts after IP. In vivo, IP-mediated cardiac protection against ischaemia/reperfusion injury was inhibited by knockdown of cardiac miR-21. In cultured cardiac myocytes, we identified that miR-21 also had a protective effect on hypoxia/reoxygenation-induced cell apoptosis that was associated with its target gene, programmed cell death 4. The protective effect of miR-21 on cardiac cell apoptosis was further confirmed in rat hearts after ischaemia/reperfusion injury in vivo. Lately, some highlight articles revealed that the altered expression of miRNAs such as miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-208 etc in hearts also contributed to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and arrhythmias. Remarkably, miR-21 expression was significantly down-regulated in infarcted areas, but was up-regulated in border areas. The down-regulation of miR-21 in the infarcted areas was inhibited by ischemic preconditioning, a known cardiac protective method. Overexpression of miR-21 via adenovirus expressing miR-21 (Ad-miR-21) decreased myocardial infarct size by 29% at 24 h and decreased the dimension of left ventricles at 2 weeks after AMI. Using both gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches in cultured cardiac myocytes, we identified that miR-21 had a protective effect on ischemia-induced cell apoptosis that was associated with its target gene programmed cell death 4 and activator protein 1 pathway. The protective effect of miR-21 against ischemia-induced cardiac myocyte damage was further confirmed in vivo by decreased cell apoptosis in the border and infarcted areas of the infarcted rat hearts after treatment with Ad-miR-21. The results suggest that miRNAs such as miR-21 may play critical roles in the early phase of AMI. The results suggest that miR-21 is sensitive to H(2)O(2) stimulation. miR-21 participates in H(2)O(2)-mediated gene regulation and functional modulation in cardiac myocytes. miR-21 might play an essential role in heart diseases related to ROS such as cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. MicroRNA-21 contributes to myocardial disease by stimulating MAP kinase signalling in fibroblasts Myocardial and circulating levels of microRNA-21 reflect left ventricular fibrosis in aortic stenosis patients MicroRNA 21 inhibits left ventricular remodeling in the early phase of rat model with ischemia-reperfusion injury by suppressing cell apoptosis MicroRNA-21 protects against the H(2)O(2)-induced injury on cardiac myocytes via its target gene PDCD4 MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system. MicroRNA-21 contributes to myocardial disease by stimulating MAP kinase signalling in fibroblasts. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a highly expressed microRNA (miRNA) in cardiovascular system miR-21 might be a novel therapeutic target in cardiovascular diseases MicroRNA-21 as therapeutic target in cancer and cardiovascular disease. These findings reveal that microRNAs can contribute to myocardial disease by an effect in cardiac fibroblasts. Our results validate miR-21 as a disease target in heart failure and establish the therapeutic efficacy of microRNA therapeutic intervention in a cardiovascular disease setting.	yes

60	56c71cb65795f9a73e00000b	Can DNA intercalators function as topoisomerase inhibitors?	The aporphine alkaloids (+)-dicentrine and (+)-bulbocapnine are non-planar molecules lacking features normally associated with DNA binding by intercalation or minor groove binding. Surprisingly, dicentrine showed significant activity as a topoisomerase II (EC 5.99.1.3) inhibitor and also was active in a DNA unwinding assay. The DNA unwinding suggests DNA intercalation, which could explain the inhibition of topoisomerase II. We found that several agents, including adriamycin (a DNA intercalator and inhibitor of topoisomerase II) Amsacrine, a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor, is efficacious as an antileukemogenic agent. Quinacrine was less effective. (ii) Inhibitors intercalating and binding to the 'cleavable' DNA-topoisomerase complex (m-AMSA, mitoxantrone, doxorubicin and daunorubicin) strongly suppressed reparative DNA incision.  DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. Among its many properties, amiloride is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor. To determine whether the ability of amiloride to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit DNA topoisomerase II was dependent on the ability to assume a cyclized conformation, we studied the structure-activity relationship for 12 amiloride analogs Empirical assays consisting of biophysical, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, as well as computational molecular modeling approaches, were used to determine conformational properties for these molecules, and to determine whether they intercalated into DNA and inhibited topoisomerase II.  Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. Thus, the ability of amiloride and the 12 analogs studied to intercalate into DNA and to inhibit topoisomerase II appears dependent on the ability to exist in a planar, hydrogen-bonded, tricyclic conformation. Abnormal expression of the nuclear-associated enzyme DNA topoisomerase II (topoisomerase II) has been implicated in the in vitro phenotype of radiation hypersensitive ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) cells and in modifying sensitivity of eukaryotic cells to topoisomerase II-inhibitor drugs [e.g., the DNA intercalator amsacrine (mAMSA)].  All three tested anthraquinones, emodin, aloe-emodin, and danthron, showed capabilities to inhibit the non-covalent binding of bisbenzimide Hoechst 33342 to isolated DNA and in mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells comparable to the topoisomerase II inhibitor and intercalator m-amsacrine. These studies suggest that AD 288 inhibits topoisomerase II activity by preventing the initial non-covalent binding of topoisomerase II to DNA. Since AD 288 is a potent DNA intercalator, catalytic inhibition is achieved by prohibiting access of the enzyme to DNA binding sites.  AQ4N (1,4-bis[[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl] amino]-5,8-dihydroxyanthracene-9, 10-dione bis-N-oxide dihydrochloride) is a prodrug which is selectively activated within hypoxic tissues to AQ4, a topoisomerase II inhibitor and DNA intercalator. Amonafide is a DNA intercalator and topoisomerase II inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of neoplastic diseases.  We found that three compounds had similar cancer cell-selective growth inhibition to amonafide, while retaining similar subcellular localization, DNA intercalation and topoisomerase II inhibition activities. Amonafide is a novel topoisomerase II (Topo II) inhibitor and DNA intercalator that induces apoptotic signaling by blocking the binding of Topo II to DNA. At higher concentrations, inhibition of Top1 catalytic activity and DNA intercalation is observed. Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of new oligopyrrole carboxamides linked with tricyclic DNA-intercalators as potential DNA ligands or topoisomerase inhibitors. It was found that 1) morpholinyldoxorubicin, cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin, and Actinomycin D (but not doxorubicin) stimulated DNA topoisomerase I-induced cleavage at specific DNA sites; 2) only doxorubicin and Actinomycin D stimulated DNA cleavage by DNA topoisomerase II; 3) at higher drug concentrations, DNA intercalators suppressed enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage induced by DNA topoisomerase I, as well as topoisomerase II; 4) only cyanomorpholinyldoxorubicin produced DNA-DNA cross-links; no DNA unwinding could be observed; and 5) DNA intercalation (unwinding) potency of morpholinyldoxorubicin was about 2-fold less than that of doxorubicin. The data indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I. The screen of cMAP for uncharacterized drugs indicated the signature of Epoxy anthraquinone derivative (EAD) matched the profiles of multiple known DNA targeted agents (topoisomerase I/II inhibitors, DNA intercalators, and DNA alkylation agents) as predicted by its structure. Cytotoxicity of several classes of antitumor DNA intercalators is thought to result from disturbance of DNA metabolism following trapping of the nuclear enzyme DNA topoisomerase II as a covalent complex on DNA. Most DNA intercalators and epipodophyllotoxins inhibit mammalian topoisomerase II by trapping the enzyme within DNA cleavage complexes that can be detected in cells as protein-associated DNA strand breaks. Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. Numerous topoisomerase I poisons including DNA minor groove binders such as Hoechst 33258 and DNA intercalators such as benzophenanthridine alkaloids and indolocarbazole derivatives have been discovered and developed. The stabilization of cleavage intermediates by intercalators may have a common mechanism for DNA topoisomerase I and DNA topoisomerase II. Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. Taken together, our results suggest that much of the activity and specificity of m-AMSA as a topoisomerase II poison is embodied in the headgroup, while DNA intercalation is used primarily to increase the affinity of m-AMSA for the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex. The cross-sensitivity patterns of the mutant were examined for covalently (anthramycin) and non-covalently (distamycin A) binding minor groove ligands, and DNA intercalating [adriamycin, mitoxantrone and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulphon-m-anisidide (mAMSA)] and non-intercalating (VP16-213) topoisomerase II poisons. Quinoline alkaloids as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. DNA intercalation and inhibition of topoisomerase II. Structure-activity relationships for a series of amiloride analogs. These include: (i) the production of improved topoisomerase inhibitors (by consideration of drug/protein as well as drug/DNA interactions); (ii) the development of reductively-activated chromophores as hypoxia-selective agents; and (iii) the use of DNA-intercalators of known DNA binding orientation as 'carriers' for the delivery of other reactive functionality specifically (sequence-, regio- and site-specifically) to DNA. Indolo[2,3-b]quinolines are a family of DNA intercalators and inhibitors of topoisomerase II, synthetic analogs of neocryptolepine, an alkaloid traditionally used in African folk medicine. Their ability to function as bis-intercalators was assessed by a novel and convenient topoisomerase fluorescent assay. Structure-activity relationship of polypyridyl ruthenium(II) complexes as DNA intercalators, DNA photocleavage reagents, and DNA topoisomerase and RNA polymerase inhibitors. In addition, fragments of about 900 kbp were detected in the cells treated with a topoisomerase inhibitor, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methane-sulfon-m-anisidine, and fragments in the broad size range between 700 and 245 kbp in the cells treated with radical producers, bleomycin and neocarzinostatin.  The data indicate that some DNA intercalators are not only inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II but act also on DNA topoisomerase I.  Long-term inhibition of DNA synthesis and the persistence of trapped topoisomerase II complexes in determining the toxicity of the antitumor DNA intercalators mAMSA and mitoxantrone. Effects of the DNA intercalators 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide and 2-methyl-9-hydroxyellipticinium on topoisomerase II mediated DNA strand cleavage and strand passage. Most DNA intercalators and epipodophyllotoxins inhibit mammalian topoisomerase II by trapping the enzyme within DNA cleavage complexes that can be detected in cells as protein-associated DNA strand breaks.  Here, molecular interactions of the potent antitumor drug amsacrine (m-AMSA), an inhibitor of topoisomerase II, within living K562 cancer cells have been studied using surface-enhanced Raman (SER) spectroscopy.  It has been shown previously that DNA intercalators can inhibit the action of amsacrine and several other topoisomerase II poisons, presumably as a result of interference with the DNA binding sites for the enzyme.  The gadd153 promoter was strongly activated by a broad spectrum of genotoxic agents including UV-mimetic agents, DNA-cross-linking and alkylating agents, DNA intercalators, and topoisomerase inhibitors.  Our study indicates that Epoxy anthraquinone derivative may be a novel DNA topoisomerase inhibitor that can be potentially used for treatment of neuroblastoma or other cancer patients. Organic intercalators can inhibit nucleic acid synthesis in vivo, and they are now common anticancer drugs in clinical therapy.  Because structurally related antitumor alkaloids such as camptothecin and fagaronine are known to function as intercalative topoisomerase poisons, it is hypothesized that cytotoxic Stauranthus alkaloids may also serve as intercalative topoisomerase inhibitors. Specifically, we measured the ability of these compounds to 1) alter the thermal denaturation profile of DNA, 2) modify the hydrodynamic behavior of DNA, 3) inhibit the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro, 4) promote the topoisomerase II-dependent cleavage of DNA, and 5) inhibit functions associated with DNA topoisomerase II in intact cells. Results indicated that only those analogs capable of cyclization could intercalate into DNA and inhibit topoisomerase II. A function for topoisomerases I and II in DNA excision repair can be postulated from the organization of the mammalian chromosome, involving nucleosomal structures and matrix-attached DNA loops. To analyse this function we determined UV-induced DNA incision in confluent human fibroblasts in the presence of 16 inhibitors of topoisomerases I and II which belonged to at least five different drug categories, based on their mechanism of action. In experiments to determine the mechanism of inhibition of DNA synthesis by amiloride, we observed that amiloride inhibited both the catalytic activity of purified DNA topoisomerase II in vitro and DNA topoisomerase II-dependent cell functions in vivo. Many compounds capable of inhibiting DNA topoisomerase II are DNA intercalators. The pyridoacridines&apos; ability to inhibit TOPO II-mediated decatenation of kDNA correlated with their cytotoxic potencies and their ability to intercalate into calf thymus DNA. These results suggest that disruption of the function of TOPO II, subsequent to intercalation, is a probable mechanism by which pyridoacridines inhibit the proliferation of HCT cells. Evidence for DNA intercalation by AD41 is provided by the observation that the drug introduces positive supercoils into covalently closed plasmid DNA. Based on these data, a hypothesis is proposed that would provide a general mechanism whereby intercalating agents and epipodophyllotoxins alter topoisomerase function and presumably exert their antitumor effects. Therefore, to more fully analyze structure-function relationships and the role of DNA binding in the action of m-AMSA, we analyzed a series of derivatives for the ability to enhance DNA cleavage mediated by human topoisomerase IIα and topoisomerase IIβ and to intercalate DNA. Results indicate that the 3&apos;-methoxy (m-AMSA) positively affects drug function, potentially by restricting the rotation of the headgroup in a favorable orientation.	yes
70	532f3e08d6d3ac6a34000034	Is shotgun lipidomics the direct infusion of a lipid sample into a mass spectrometer?	In direct infusion/injection (or shotgun) lipidomics An efficient shotgun lipidomics strategy was established and optimized for fast phospholipid profiling of viscera from three fish species: Lateolabrax japonicas, Ctenopharyngodon idellus, and Carassius auratus. This strategy relies on direct infusion of total lipid extracts into a tandem mass spectrometer without additional separation of the individual molecular species.  Top-down shotgun lipidomics relies on direct infusion of total lipid extracts into a high-resolution tandem mass spectrometer shotgun lipidomic approaches that use direct infusion direct infusion (shotgun lipidomics)  direct infusion-based shotgun lipidomics approaches shotgun lipidomics (MDMS-SL) data, which are acquired directly from lipid extracts after direct infusion  Through direct infusion of the resultant enriched solution, we identified and quantitated a variety of very-low-abundance sphingolipid classes (e.g., sphingosine, psychosine, and lysosphingomyelin) and molecular species (e.g., sphingomyelin) using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (i.e., shotgun sphingolipidomics).	yes

75	5335b373d6d3ac6a34000050	Is ospemifene effective for treatment of dyspareunia?	Ospemifene, a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator, has been developed for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia in postmenopausal women.  For the comparison of short-term ospemifene with placebo, parabasal cells (the standardized mean difference [SMD] = -37.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -41.83 to -33.17, P < 0.00001), superficial cells (SMD = 9.24, 95% CI = 7.70 to 10.79, P < 0.00001), vaginal PH (SMD = -0.89, 95% CI = -0.98 to -0.80, P = 0.00001), and dyspareunia (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.43 to -0.30, P = 0.00001) indicated that ospemifene was more effective than the placebo.  This meta-analysis indicates that ospemifene to be an effective and safe treatment for dyspareunia associated with postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy. Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or estrogen receptor agonist/antagonist, that was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy, a chronic condition that affects up to 60% of postmenopausal women. In conclusion, ospemifene is a SERM with a unique estrogen agonist/antagonist tissue profile that was recently approved in the US for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women.  To characterize the pharmacokinetics of the oral, non-estrogen agent ospemifene, an estrogen agonist/antagonist with tissue-selective effects (also called a selective estrogen receptor modulator) that was recently approved for the treatment of dyspareunia associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. Here, we review the estrogen agonist/antagonist profile of ospemifene, a novel triphenylethylene derivative recently approved to treat dyspareunia, a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) due to menopause, both preclinically and clinically.  Long-term studies on the endometrial safety of local estrogen and ospemifene are lacking.  Ospemifene is a tissue-selective estrogen agonist/antagonist (a selective estrogen receptor modulator) recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, due to menopause. SERMs with positive vaginal effects (such as improvement in the vaginal maturation index, reduced vaginal pH, and improvement in the signs and symptoms of VVA) on postmenopausal symptomatic women include lasofoxifene (clinical development on hold) and ospemifene, which was recently approved for the treatment of VVA-related dyspareunia, with a class effect warning of potential venous thrombosis risk.  Ospemifene is the first non-estrogen treatment approved for moderate to severe dyspareunia in women with menopause-related vulvar and vaginal atrophy.  This article summarizes the milestones in the development of ospemifene leading to this first approval for moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of postmenopausal vulvar and vaginal atrophy. The aim of this work was to study the role of ospemifene, a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator, in the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with moderate to severe dyspareunia and physiological vaginal changes.  In this study, once-daily oral ospemifene 60 mg was effective for the treatment of vulvar and vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women with dyspareunia. Clinical trials have confirmed that daily doses are well-tolerated and that it is effective in normalizing vaginal maturation index and pH as well as improving the symptoms associated with VVA including dyspareunia. Ospemifene was shown to be effective and well tolerated for the treatment of the symptoms of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia associated with vulvovaginal atrophy over and above the use of provided lubricants.	yes
85	5176c6d08ed59a060a000032	Have mutations in the Polycomb group been found in human diseases?	We identify a novel mutation in PHC1, a human orthologue of the Drosophila polyhomeotic member of polycomb group (PcG), which significantly decreases PHC1 protein expression, increases Geminin protein level and markedly abolishes the capacity to ubiquitinate histone H2A in patient cells. In clinical specimens of head and neck cancer, we found that coamplification of BMI1 and AURKA correlated with poorer prognosis. Mutations of EZH2, RUNX1, TP53, and ASXL1 were associated with shorter overall survival independent of the LR-PSS. In this study, we show the high frequency of spontaneous γδ T-cell leukemia (T-ALL) occurrence in mice with biallelic deletion of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (Ezh2). Subsequently, analysis of deletion profiles of other PRC2 members revealed frequent losses of genes such as EZH2, AEBP2, and SUZ12; however, the deletions targeting these genes were large. We also identified two patients with homozygous losses of JARID2 and AEBP2. We observed frequent codeletion of AEBP2 and ETV6, and similarly, SUZ12 and NF1. A total of 25 different EZH2 mutations were detected in 5.9% of PMF, 1.2% of PPV-MF, and 9.4% of PET-MF patients; most were exonic heterozygous missense changes. In the present investigation we have focused on the candidate region in 6p23, a region that have been found linked to CL/P in several investigations, in the attempt to find out the susceptibility gene provisionally named OFC1. Gene expression experiments in mice embryo of positional candidate genes revealed that JARID2 was highly and specifically expressed in epithelial cells in merging palatal shelves. High expression of EZH2 and amplification of EZH2 was found in 54.1% and 12.0% of ESCCs, respectively. We also observed that HOXA9 levels were significantly inversely correlated with survival and that BMI-1 was overexpressed in cases with 11q23 rearrangements, suggesting that p19(ARF) suppression may be involved in MLL-associated leukemia. We demonstrate that in multiple experimental models of metastatic prostate cancer both BMI1 and Ezh2 genes are amplified and gene amplification is associated with increased expression of corresponding mRNAs and proteins. he EZH2 gene amplification was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with increased EZH2 protein expression. The third tumor showed a t(6p;10q;10p) as the sole karyotypic abnormality, leading to the fusion of PHF1 with another partner, the enhancer of polycomb (EPC1) gene from 10p11; EPC1 has hitherto not been associated with neoplasia.	yes

Here we review the statistical foundations of that test and consider three non-parametric tests based upon different correlation metrics and one parametric test to evaluate if Z ∼ 1/X in genomes. The most powerful test is a new non-parametric one based upon the correlation ratio, which is able to reject Z ∼ 1/X in nine out of 11 taxonomic groups and detect a borderline group.

129	54f7291630767eb92e000002	Are epigenetic modifications implicated in cardiovascular development and disease?	Gene expression regulation through the interplay of DNA methylation and histone modifications is well-established, although the knowledge about the function of epigenetic signatures in cardiovascular disease is still largely unexplored. The study of epigenetic markers is, therefore, a very promising frontier of science which may aid in a deeper understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the modulation of gene expression in the biomolecule pathways linked to cardiovascular diseases. This review highlights our current knowledge of epigenetic gene regulation and the evidence that chromatin remodeling and histone modifications play key roles in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease through (re)programming of cardiovascular (stem) cells commitment, identity and function. Notably, multiple subunits of switching defective/sucrose non-fermenting (SWI/SNF) chromatin-remodeling complexes have been identified as strong candidates underlying these defects because they physically and functionally interact with cardiogenic transcription factors critical to cardiac development, such as TBX5, GATA-4, and NKX2-5. While these studies indicate a critical role of SWI/SNF complexes in cardiac development and congenital heart disease, many exciting new discoveries have identified their critical role in the adult heart in both physiological and pathological conditions involving multiple cell types in the heart, including cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells, pericytes, and neural crest cells. Recent studies have greatly expanded our understanding of the regulation of cardiovascular development at the chromatin level, including the remodeling of chromatin and the modification of histones. Chromatin-level regulation integrates multiple inputs and coordinates broad gene expression programs. Thus, understanding chromatin-level regulation will allow for a better appreciation of gene regulation as a whole and may set a fundamental basis for cardiovascular disease. Genetic and epigenetic factors are of great importance in cardiovascular biology and disease. Tobacco-smoking, one of the most important cardiovascular risk factors, is itself partially determined by genetic background and is associated with altered epigenetic patterns. Epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation, histone modification (acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation) and miRNA, are critical for regulating developmental events. However, aberrant epigenetic mechanisms may lead to pathological consequences such as cardiovascular disease (CAD), neurodegenerative disease, obesity, metabolic disorder, bone and skeletal diseases and various cancers. Cardiovascular disease pathways are now being approached from the epigenetic perspective, including those associated with atherosclerosis, angiogenesis, ischemia-reperfusion damage, and the cardiovascular response to hypoxia and shear stress, among many others. With increasing interest and expanding partnerships in the field, we can expect new insights to emerge from epigenetic perspectives of cardiovascular health. Epigenetic modifications are heritable alterations of the genome, which can govern gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. The purpose of this review is to render an overview of the possible mechanisms of epigenetic regulation of gene expression in response to environmental pollutants leading to cardiovascular diseases (CVD). From varied study approaches directed either toward the general understanding of the key pathway regulatory genes, or sampling population cohorts for global and gene-specific changes, it has been possible to identify several epigenetic signatures of environmental exposure relevant to CVD. An understanding of chromatin remodelling in response to environmental stimuli conducive to CVD is emerging, with the promise of novel diagnostic and therapeutic candidates. Consolidated knowledge is accumulating as to the role of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in the physiology of vascular development and vascular tone as well as in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. The modulation of gene expression through modification of the epigenome by structural changes of the chromatin architecture without alterations of the associated genomic DNA sequence is part of the cellular response to environmental changes. Such environmental conditions, which are finally being translated into adaptations of the cardiovascular system, also comprise pathological conditions such as atherosclerosis or myocardial infarction.  Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease. Histone modifications lead to the modulation of the expression of genetic information through modification of DNA accessibility. In addition, RNA-based mechanisms (e.g., microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs) influence the development of disease. We here outline the recent work pertaining to epigenetic changes in a cardiovascular disease setting. Epigenetics may represent one of the possible scientific explanations of the impact of such intrauterine risk factors for the subsequent development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) during adulthood. Epigenetic mechanisms include DNA methylation, histone modification, and microRNA alterations, which collectively enable the cell to respond quickly to environmental changes. A number of CVD risk factors, such as nutrition, smoking, pollution, stress, and the circadian rhythm, have been associated with modification of epigenetic marks. Further examination of these mechanisms may lead to earlier prevention and novel therapy for CVD.  Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease. Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease. Epigenetic alterations are associated with inflammation and cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease. Emerging data suggest that these epigenetic modifications also impact on the development of cardiovascular disease Epigenetic mechanisms that underpin metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. Epigenetic regulation of cardiovascular differentiation. Epigenetic control mechanisms play a key role in the regulation of embryonic development and tissue homeostasis and modulate cardiovascular diseases.	yes
139	56cf27293975bb303a000003	Does ziconotide bind to N-type calcium channels?	Since this region partially overlaps with residues previously implicated in block of the channel by omega-conotoxin GVIA, we assessed the effects of mutations in the putative EF hand domain on channel block by omega-conotoxin GVIA and the structurally related omega-conotoxin MVIIA. Both of the toxins irreversibly block the activity of wild type alpha(1B) N-type channels.  Despite their high sequence homology, the peptide neurotoxins omega-conotoxin MVIIA and MVIIC selectively block N- and P/Q-type calcium channels, respectively.   Binding assay for both N- and P/Q-type calcium channels showed that amino acid residues restricted to the N-terminal half are important for the recognition of N-type channels, whereas essential residues for P/Q-type channel recognition are widely spread over the whole omega-conotoxin molecule. Ziconotide is a novel peptide that blocks the entry of calcium into neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, preventing the conduction of nerve signals. Ziconotide is a selective, potent and reversible blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs). The therapeutic benefit of ziconotide derives from its potent and selective blockade of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Interactions of intrathecally administered ziconotide, a selective blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, with morphine on nociception in rats. Ziconotide, a new N-type calcium channel blocker, administered intrathecally for acute postoperative pain. Ziconotide, an intrathecally administered N-type calcium channel antagonist for the treatment of chronic pain. Thus, ziconotide is the first of a new class of agents--N-type calcium channel blockers, or NCCBs. Ziconotide, formerly known also as SNX- 111, represents a new class of agents, the N-type calcium channel blockers. The selective N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide ameliorates severe chronic pain but has a narrow therapeutic window and requires intrathecal administration. A selective N-type calcium channel inhibitor, ziconotide (Prialt), is a neuroactive peptide recently marketed as a novel nonopioid treatment for severe chronic pain. As the clinically available analgesics, pregabalin (alpha2delta-subunit calcium channel ligand), ziconotide (N-type calcium channel blocker), mexiletine (sodium channel blocker), and duloxetine (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) were evaluated in these neurochemically-induced allodynia models. The present investigation was designed to assess the safety and analgesic efficacy of ziconotide, a new N-type calcium channel blocker, when administered intrathecally to patients with acute postoperative pain. Inhibition of the N-type calcium channel by intrathecal administration of the channel-specific blocker omega-conotoxin MVIIA (ziconotide) is efficacious in the treatment of severe chronic pain. Ziconotide is a powerful analgesic drug that has a unique mechanism of action involving potent and selective block of N-type calcium channels, which control neurotransmission at many synapses. In conclusion, present findings provide implication that the spinal anti-nociceptive mechanistic site of pregabalin is different from that of ziconotide, mexiletine, and duloxetine, and pregabalin could have a broader anti-nociceptive mechanism other than N-type calcium channel blockade. Ziconotide (SNX-111), a selective blocker of neuronal N-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels, is antinociceptive when it is administered intrathecally. Effects of intrathecal administration of ziconotide, a selective neuronal N-type calcium channel blocker, on mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia in a rat model of postoperative pain. A state-dependent Ca(V)2.2 inhibitor may provide an improved therapeutic window over ziconotide, the peptidyl Ca(V)2.2 inhibitor used clinically.  There is also human validation data from ziconotide, the CaV2.2-selective peptidyl inhibitor used clinically to treat refractory pain.  A selective N-type calcium channel inhibitor, ziconotide (Prialt), is a neuroactive peptide recently marketed as a novel nonopioid treatment for severe chronic pain.  The neuroprotective effects of intrathecal administration of the selective N-type calcium channel blocker ziconotide in a rat model of spinal ischemia.	yes
148	54c26e29f693c3b16b000003	Is Calcium homeostasis important in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology?	Maintenance of cellular calcium homeostasis is critical to regulating mitochondrial ATP production and cardiac contraction.  the Ca(2+) signal regulates the most important activities of the cell, from the expression of genes, to heart and muscle contraction and other motility processes, to diverse metabolic pathways involved in the generation of cell fuels Pharmacologic modification of cellular calcium handling recently moved into focus as an alternative for prevention and treatment of ventricular tachyarrhythmias diabetic rats displayed abnormal cardiac structure and systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and spermine (CaSR agonist) could prevent or slow its progression. These results indicate that the CaSR expression of myocardium is reduced in the progress of DCM, and its potential mechanism is related to the impaired intracellular calcium homeostasis. calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) plays important roles in cardiac electrical activity and calcium homeostasis. NCX current (I(NCX)) shows transmural gradient across left ventricle in many species. Previous studies demonstrated that NCX expression was increased and transmural gradient of I(NCX) was disrupted in failing heart calcium homeostasis, the key process underlying excitation-contraction coupling The results indicate the calcium handling properties of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes are relatively immature to hESC counterparts Our understanding of the molecular processes which regulate cardiac function has grown immeasurably in recent years. Even with the advent of β-blockers, angiotensin inhibitors and calcium modulating agents, heart failure (HF) still remains a seriously debilitating and life-threatening condition. Here, we review the molecular changes which occur in the heart in response to increased load and the pathways which control cardiac hypertrophy, calcium homeostasis, and immune activation during HF. Calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) are G-protein coupled receptors which maintain systemic calcium homeostasis and participate in hormone secretion, activation of ion channels, cell apoptosis, proliferation, and differentiation. CaSRs are associated with I/R injury and apoptosis in neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes via suppressing Bcl-2 and promoting caspase-3 expression. Important insights into the molecular basis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and related diseases have been gained by studying families with inherited cardiac hypertrophy. Integrated clinical and genetic investigations have demonstrated that different genetic defects can give rise to the common phenotype of cardiac hypertrophy. Diverse pathways have been identified, implicating perturbations in force generation, force transmission, intracellular calcium homeostasis, myocardial energetics, and cardiac metabolism in causing disease HAX-1 as a regulator of contractility and calcium cycling in the heart. HAX-1 overexpression reduced sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA2) pump activity in isolated cardiomyocytes and in vivo, leading to depressed myocyte calcium kinetics and mechanics. Thus, HAX-1 represents a regulatory mechanism in cardiac calcium cycling and its responses to sympathetic stimulation, implicating its importance in calcium homeostasis and cell survival. Calcium ions are the most ubiquitous and versatile signaling molecules in eukaryotic cells. Calcium homeostasis and signaling systems are crucial for both the normal growth of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the intricate working of the mammalian heart. this knowledge can be used to help treat relevant human diseases such as pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure With aging, the heart develops myocyte hypertrophy associated with impaired relaxation indices. To define the cellular basis of this adaptation, we examined the physiological changes that arise in calcium handling in the aging heart and contrasted the adaptations that occur following the imposition of a stimulus that alters calcium homeostasis in a young and an old heart alterations in the calcium-handling machinery of the cardiocyte differ in the context of age and as such may predispose the older heart to the development of a hypertrophic phenotype. The cardiac sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX1) is a key sarcolemmal protein for the maintenance of calcium homeostasis in the heart.  Thus exchanger overexpression in mice leads to abnormal calcium handling and a decompensatory transition to heart failure with stress Central to controlling intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) are a number of Ca(2+) transporters and channels with the L-type Ca(2+) channel, Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) being of particular note in the heart. This review concentrates on the regulation of [Ca(2+)](i) in cardiac muscle and the homeostatic mechanisms employed to ensure that the heart can operate under steady-state conditions on a beat by beat basis. the tight regulation of SR Ca(2+) content is also required to prevent the abnormal, spontaneous or diastolic release of Ca(2+) from the SR. Such diastolic events are a major factor contributing to the genesis of cardiac arrhythmias in disease situations and in recently identified familial mutations in the SR Ca(2+) release channel (ryanodine receptor, RyR). Calcium channels have a unique functional role, because not only do they participate in this activity, they form the means by which electrical signals are converted to responses within the cell. Calcium channels play an integral role in excitation in the heart and shaping the cardiac action potential. In addition, calcium influx through calcium channels is responsible for initiating contraction. Abnormalities in calcium homeostasis underlie cardiac arrhythmia, contractile dysfunction and cardiac remodelling.  Cardiac calcium (Ca(2+)) handling subsumes the mechanisms maintaining the myocardial Ca(2+) homeostasis that contribute essentially to cardiac performance. Calcium is an important mediator in cardiac excitation and disorders in cardiac Ca(2+) homeostasis have great influence on the cardiac action potential. We review the physiology of the cardiac calcium homeostasis, including the cardiac excitation contraction coupling and myocyte calcium cycling. We review the physiology of the cardiac calcium homeostasis, including the cardiac excitation contraction coupling and myocyte calcium cycling Calcium is an important mediator in cardiac excitation and disorders in cardiac Ca(2+) homeostasis have great influence on the cardiac action potential The role of calcium in cardiac and vascular smooth muscle physiology was reviewed, highlighting the major mechanisms responsible for maintaining calcium homeostasis in these cells Energy metabolism and Ca(2+) handling serve critical roles in cardiac physiology and pathophysiology	yes
151	554614bcd355485447000004	Does d-tubocurarine (d-TC) induces irreversible inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) at the neuromuscular junction?	An integrated model describing the interaction of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents with reversible anticholinesterase agents is derived and compared with a naive model using experimental data obtained from four anesthetized dogs. Three consecutive but separate steady-state d-tubocurarine blocks (approximately 50, 70, and 90%) were induced in each of the four dogs and reversed by short edrophonium infusions. The ability of hexamethonium (C6) to reverse the neuromuscular blocking action of tubocurarine (Tc) Volatile anesthetics enhance the neuromuscular blockade produced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants (NDMRs). The neuromuscular junction is a postulated site of this interaction. We tested the hypothesis that volatile anesthetic enhancement of muscle relaxation is the result of combined drug effects on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Concentration-effect curves for the inhibition of acetylcholine-induced currents were established for vecuronium, d-tubocurarine, isoflurane, and sevoflurane. Subsequently, inhibitory effects of NDMRs were studied in the presence of the volatile anesthetics at a concentration equivalent to half the concentration producing a 50% inhibition alone. All individually tested compounds produced rapid and readily reversible concentration-dependent inhibition. The pharmacological diversity of the different isoforms of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor arises from the diversity of the subunits that assemble to form the native receptors. The aim of this study was to investigate the actions of the muscle relaxants d-tubocurarine, pancuronium and vecuronium on different isoforms of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors At all three receptor types, d-tubocurarine and pancuronium blocked the responses elicited by acetylcholine in a reversible manner.  As further evidence of anticholinesterase activity, methamidophos (1-100 microM) was able to reverse the blockade by d-tubocurarine There was an initial partial reversal of the neuromuscular inhibition caused by tubocurarine Isoflurane and sevoflurane enhance the receptor blocking effects of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Because other purinergic 2X (P2X) receptor antagonists, NF023 and NF279, do not have the reverse effects on the neuromuscular blockade of d-TC, the effect of NF449 seems irrelevant to inhibition of P2X receptors. The association rate constant for Tc binding to sites on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor appears to be very fast (k+D = 8.9 x 10(8) M-1 s-1) and comparable to that for acetylcholine (ACh). The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism for the reversal effect of NF449 (a suramin analogue) on the neuromuscular block induced by d-tubocurarine (d-TC). Study of the reversal effect of NF449 on neuromuscular blockade induced by d-tubocurarine.	no
164	516523fd298dcd4e51000055	Could Arimidex (anastrozole) cause hot flashes?	More than a third of breast cancer patients undergoing aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment report joint pain. In the first 6 weeks, emergence of joint pain was associated with increase in general pain, fatigue, disturbed sleep, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and decreased sexual activity. Antiestrogen therapy can cause vasomotor symptoms similar to those occurring during menopause, including hot flashes. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of acupuncture for treatment of hot flashes in Korean patients with breast cancer receiving antiestrogen therapy. 10 patients with breast cancer who were undergoing antiestrogen therapy with tamoxifen or anastrozole and who were suffering from hot flashes. During treatment, severity of hot flashes was reduced by 70%-95% in all patients. anastrozole has been widely used in Japan as an adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal, hormone-responsive breast cancer patients. The aim of this study is to evaluate the rate of bone fracture and bone mineral density (BMD) during anastrozole treatment in Japanese patients. Musculoskeletal disorders were the most common (26.1 %), and hot flashes were the second most common adverse event (7.9 %). To compare the effect of therapy with anastrozole versus a combination of fulvestrant and anastrozole in women in first relapse of endocrine-responsive breast cancer. fulvestrant loading dose (LD) regimen followed by monthly injection plus 1 mg of anastrozole daily or to 1 mg of anastrozole daily alone. Incidences of prespecified adverse events (AEs) were similar. Hot flashes were more common in the experimental arm: 63 patients (24.6%) versus 35 patients (13.8%) in the standard arm (P = .0023). The third-generation agents (anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane) have been shown to be more effective and safer than the selective estrogen receptor modulators tamoxifen and raloxifen. AIs are well tolerated and cause a lower incidence of gynecological symptoms (vaginal bleeding, discharge, and endometrial neoplasia), venous thromboembolic events, and hot flashes compared with tamoxifen. Mood disturbances, somnolence, anxiety, fatigue, hot flashes, and memory impairment have been reported among patients receiving anastrozole as adjuvant therapy. Twenty-five PM-BC patients received, in sequence, leuprorelin, taxane-anthracycline induction chemotherapy, radiation therapy, a platinum-based intensification high-dose CT, followed by leuprorelin and anastrazole for five years. Grade 4 hematologic toxicity was observed in all patients, no patient showed a decrease of cardiac ejection fraction and hot flashes and arthralgias were of moderate intensity. Of the patients treated with anastrozole, 3 (37.5%) reported toxicity, with 1 report each of decreased libido, leg swelling, and depression (12.5%). Toxicity was reported in 2 patients taking letrozole (40%), with both reporting peripheral edema, and 1 reporting hot flashes. Patients were treated with goserelin 3.6 mg subcutaneous monthly and began anastrozole 1-mg daily 21 days after the first injection of goserelin. The most common adverse events were fatigue (50%), arthralgias (53%), and hot flashes (59%). These studies were designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AIs in the following clinical settings: 1) as initial adjuvant therapy (the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination trial, Breast International Group Trial 1-98), AIs were tolerated well, and patients who received them experienced fewer thrombolic events and less endometrial cancer, hot flashes, night sweats, and vaginal bleeding compared with patients who receive tamoxifen. It has been suggested that the association of AI and GnRh analogues and AI could block the two routes of oestrogen production in males, and therefore this approach could increase efficacy. However, it could also enhance the rate of adverse events (hot flashes, sexual impotence, etc.). We reviewed therapeutic effects and harmful side effects in 33 patients with advanced or recurrent breast cancer who underwent treatment with Anastrozole 1 mg/day in our department. The most frequent harmful side effects were rise in total cholesterol, general fatigue, hot flashes and arthralgia (9.1%). We analyzed the changes in frequency and severity of menopausal symptoms in patients receiving tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors and identified factors influencing these symptoms. Both first-line tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors induced an increase in the occurrence and severity of hot flashes (p<0.0001 and p=0.014, respectively). To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the selective aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (Arimidex), we conducted a phase II trial in 53 women with asymptomatic recurrent/persistent müllerian cancer. Toxicity was modest (grade I) and infrequent, with the most common toxicities being fatigue and hot flashes. The first analysis of the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination) trial (median follow-up, 33 months) demonstrated that in adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal patients with early-stage breast cancer, anastrozole was superior to tamoxifen in terms of disease-free survival (DFS), time to recurrence (TTR), and incidence of contralateral breast cancer (CLBC). in that endometrial cancer (P = 0.007), vaginal bleeding and discharge (P < 0.001 for both), cerebrovascular events (P < 0.001), venous thromboembolic events (P < 0.001), and hot flashes (P < 0.001) all occurred less frequently in the anastrozole group, whereas musculoskeletal disorders and fractures (P < 0.001 for both) continued to occur less frequently in the tamoxifen group. reduced nausea, hot flashes, and abdominal discomfort caused almost twice as many patients to prefer to continue with letrozole therapy than with anastrozole	yes
171	532f05bdd6d3ac6a34000026	Has proteomics been used in the study of Pick's disease?	In Pick's disease, increased AGE, CML, CEL, HNE and MDAL bands of about 50 kDa were observed in the frontal cortex (but not in the occipital cortex) in association with increased density of glial acidic protein bands. Thus, brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with Alzheimer's disease, Down syndrome, Pick's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and other disorders as well as brain and CSF from animals serving as models of neurological disorders have been analyzed by proteomics.  The present study is designed to investigate expression of peroxiredoxins (Prxs), the newly characterized family of highly conserved antioxidant enzymes, and other antioxidant enzymes in frontal cortex and cerebellum of DS, AD and PD patients using the technique of proteomics.  HMT levels were measured in the frontal cortex and cerebellum of brains of patients with AD, DS, and PiD, and normal aged subjects using proteomics techniques. 	yes
183	515df98f298dcd4e51000030	Is Bladder training an effective method to treat  urge incontinence ?	Mindfulness-based stress reduction appears to be a treatment worthy of further study, as in the short term, it is as effective as historical studies of drug treatment and bladder training in reducing urge incontinence and incontinence-related quality of life. All patients, irrespective of the results of cystometry were subsequently treated with oxybutynin 2.5 mg twice daily along with bladder training. Of the 29 patients with stable bladder and symptoms of OAB, 100% cure rate was achieved in 20 (68.9%) and 06 (20.6%) patients respectively. While in 3 patients in both groups, decrease of symptoms upto 75% after 6 months of treatment was observed. Both urodynamically proven unstable and stable bladder showed nearly equal improvement with treatment There are 3 types of urine incontinence (urge-, stress-, and overflow-incontinence). Another standardization of urinary incontinence follows dysfunctions of the pelvic floor: detrusor muscle-dependent, due to sphincter spasm, prostate gland dependent. Urge incontinence with a dysfunction of the detrusor muscle is the most common type. Mixed types are frequent. Non-drug measures (e.g. pelvic muscle training, bladder training, toilet training are first choice treatments. Treatment of stress, urge and mixed incontinence can usually be commenced in primary care; pelvic floor exercises and bladder training are preferred. If bladder training is not effective for urge incontinence, anticholinergic drugs should be considered. Sixty patients (age 8 to 12 years) with urge incontinence or dysfunctional voiding were evaluated. After a no-treatment control period (average 6 months), patients underwent a 6-day bladder training course Six months after training completion, 64.1% and 64.7% of the inpatient and outpatient groups with daytime wetting and 51.5% and 17.7% of the inpatient and outpatient groups with nighttime wetting were cured or had improved Of the inpatient group with urge incontinence, the functional bladder capacity increased by 15%. To compare the efficacy of tolterodine plus simplified bladder training (BT) with tolterodine alone in patients with an overactive bladder. CONCLUSIONS: Tolterodine 2 mg twice daily is an effective and well tolerated treatment for an overactive bladder, the effectiveness of which can be augmented by a simplified BT regimen. Bladder training is a modification of bladder drill that is conducted more gradually on an outpatient basis and has resulted in significant reduction of incontinence in older, community-dwelling women. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term effect of treatment of female incontinence by the general practitioner (pelvic floor exercises, and bladder training) in female urinary incontinence. Stress incontinence and urge incontinence were treated by means of pelvic floor exercises and bladder training respectively, while a mixed incontinence was treated by bladder training followed by pelvic floor exercises. T The treatment consisted of training of pelvic muscles in stress incontinence and bladder training in urge incontinence RESULTS: After 3 months the mean frequency of urine loss per week diminished from 21 to 8, and after 12 months to 6 times. Some elders suffering from urge incontinence prefer pelvic muscle exercises to bladder training as the behavioral intervention of choice for eight out of nine women their continence had improved, both subjectively and objectively. Bladder training is a simple, safe, and effective treatment in the management of mild to moderate forms of urinary incontinence in outpatient populations. It can be used as a first-line treatment or in combination with such other interventions as pelvic muscle exercises, bladder pressure biofeedback, electrical stimulation, and drug therapy Treatment consisted of pelvic floor exercises in the case of stress incontinence and bladder training in the case of urge incontinence. After 3 months about 60% of the patients were either dry or only mildly incontinent terodiline group shows this drug to be a valuable adjunct to a bladder regimen in children with urge incontinence Basing on our experience with 39 patients with severe urge incontinence (in one-quarter of the cases pure urge incontinence, in one-half of the cases mixed incontinence and in a further quarter of the cases neurogenic bladder disorders) a supervised programme (mictiogram) and a well-tried therapy (especially in the Anglo-Saxon countries) consisting of the triad hospitalisation/bladder training/medication therapy are presented. After an average hospitalisation period of 14 days, we were able to achieve a symptom-free state in 94% of the patients. Anamnestic and urodynamical results are evaluated before and after bladder retraining drill (BRD) in women suffering from urge incontinence. We could state that the BRD is a good possibility to realize multistep-therapy of female incontinence. Twenty consecutive female patients with urge incontinence and stable detrusor function on provocative rapid fill CO2-cystometry were treated as out-patients with a bladder training programme and with terodiline/placebo in a double-blind cross-over design. In conclusion, female patients with idiopathic urge incontinence and stable detrusor function did respond to treatment as do female patients with urge incontinence and proven instability. The results of in-patient bladder training in 65 women with frequency, urgency and urge incontinence are reported. There was a good initial response in 88%. By 6 months the response rate had fallen to 38%. Patients with sensory urgency appeared to do better than those with detrusor instability and it is suggested that bladder training may be indicated as primary treatment in sensory urgency. Bladder training and/or biofeedback techniques were used to treat 75 patients with frequency, urgency, nocturia and urge incontinence. Significant improvement or cure was obtained in 70 per cent of enuretic children, and 66 per cent of men and 74 per cent of women with unstable detrusor function.	yes
185	5357b5ecf1005d6b58000007	Is PER3 required for CHK2 activation in human cells?	Per3, a circadian gene, is required for Chk2 activation in human cells. Depletion of Per3 by siRNA almost completely abolished activation of checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) after inducing DNA damage in human cells. Per3 overexpression induced Chk2 activation in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, Per3 overexpression also led to the inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death. These combined results suggest that Per3 is a checkpoint protein that plays important roles in checkpoint activation, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Depletion of Per3 by siRNA almost completely abolished activation of checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2) after inducing DNA damage in human cells Per3 overexpression induced Chk2 activation in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, and this activation depended on ATM In addition, Per3 physically interacted with ATM and Chk2	yes
192	52b2f0864003448f55000007	Can mutations in Calmodulin cause ventricular fibrillation?	We characterized a family presenting with a history of ventricular fibrillation (VF) and sudden death without ECG or echocardiographic abnormalities at rest. Two siblings died suddenly at the ages of 9 and 10 years, and another two were resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with documented VF at age 10 and 16, respectively. Exome sequencing identified a missense mutation affecting a highly conserved residue (p.Phe90Leu) in the CALM1 gene encoding calmodulin. This mutation was also carried by one of the sibs who died suddenly, for whom DNA was available. The mutation was present in the mother and in an sibling, both asymptomatic but displaying a marginally prolonged QT-interval during exercise. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a mutation in CALM1 underlying IVF manifesting in childhood and adolescence. The causality of the mutation is supported by previous studies demonstrating that Phe90 mediates the direct interaction of CaM with target peptides Here we show that calmodulin (CaM), a ubiquitous Ca2+-sensing protein, binds to the carboxy-terminal 'IQ' domain of the human cardiac Na channel (hH1) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. This binding interaction significantly enhances slow inactivation-a channel-gating process linked to life-threatening idiopathic ventricular arrhythmias. Mutations targeted to the IQ domain disrupted CaM binding and eliminated Ca2+/CaM-dependent slow inactivation, whereas the gating effects of Ca2+/CaM were restored by intracellular application of a peptide modelled after the IQ domain. 	yes

Genome-wide analysis of fragile sites by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and microarray (ChIP-chip) of phosphorylated H2A in these mutants supported a transcription-dependent mechanism of DNA damage characteristic of R loops We have used a bisulfite-sensitivity assay to demonstrate genome-wide increase in the occurrence of RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops), including from antisense and read-through transcripts, in a nusG missense mutant defective for Rho-dependent termination. The results demonstrate a key function of FACT in the resolution of R-loop-mediated transcription-replication conflicts, likely associated with a specific chromatin organization. Previous work revealed that GC skew and R-loop formation associate with a core set of unmethylated CpG island (CGI) promoters in the human genome	yes
235	57091eefcf1c325851000016	Is NOD1 activated in inflammation?	Nod1 and Nod2 control bacterial infections and inflammation The Nod proteins Nod1 and Nod2 are two NLR family members that trigger immune defense in response to bacterial peptidoglycan Nod proteins fight off bacterial infections by stimulating proinflammatory signaling and cytokine networks and by inducing antimicrobial effectors, such as nitric oxide and antimicrobial peptides. Nod1 is also critically implicated in shaping adaptive immune responses towards bacterial-derived constituents. Together, Nod1 and Nod2 represent central players in the control of immune responses to bacterial infections and inflammation. The innate immune receptor Nod1 protects the intestine from inflammation-induced tumorigenesis. we show that Nod1 deficiency results in the increased development of both colitis-associated and Apc tumor suppressor-related colon tumors. In the absence of Nod1 signaling, there is a greater disruption of the intestinal epithelial cell barrier due to chemically induced injury as manifested by increased surface epithelial apoptosis early on during chemically induced colitis and increased intestinal permeability. The increased intestinal permeability is associated with enhanced inflammatory cytokine production and epithelial cell proliferation in Nod1-deficient mice as compared with wild-type mice. Depletion of the gut microbiota suppressed tumor development in Nod1-deficient mice, thus highlighting a link between the commensal bacteria within the intestine and the host innate immune Nod1 signaling pathway in the regulation inflammation-mediated colon cancer development.  NOD1 protein is expressed in the eye and promotes ocular inflammation in a dose- and time-dependent fashion.  NOD1 expression in the eye and functional contribution to IL-1beta-dependent ocular inflammation in mice Polymorphisms in NOD1 are associated with autoinflammatory diseases characterized by uveitis such as Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis NOD1 is homologous to NOD2, which is responsible for an autosomal dominant form of uveitis. Nonetheless, the role of NOD1 in intraocular inflammation has not been explored. Nod1 and Nod2 regulation of inflammation in the Salmonella colitis model mice deficient for both Nod1 and Nod2 had attenuated inflammatory pathology, reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines, and increased colonization of the mucosal tissue The present study has demonstrated an unexpected role of Nod1 in the development of site-specific vascular inflammation, especially coronary arteritis. Nod1 ligands induce site-specific vascular inflammation Phenotyping of Nod1/2 double deficient mice and characterization of Nod1/2 in systemic inflammation and associated renal disease The present study analyzed Nod1 and Nod2 double deficient (Nod1/2 DKO) mice under physiological and inflammatory conditions Several inflammatory disorders, such as Crohn's disease and asthma, are linked to genetic changes in either Nod1 or Nod2. Systematic analysis of Nod1/2 DKO mice revealed a possible role of Nod1/2 in the development of renal disease during systemic inflammation. NOD1 and NOD2 Signaling in Infection and Inflammation NOD1 engagement generates an inflammatory response via activation of NFκB and MAPK pathways.  In addition we profile novel inhibitors of RIP2 and NOD1 itself, which specifically inhibit NOD1 ligand induced inflammatory signalling in the vasculature.  This data supports the potential utility of NOD1 and RIP2 as therapeutic targets in human disease where vascular inflammation is a clinical feature, such as in sepsis and septic shock. NOD1 expression elicited by iE-DAP in first trimester human trophoblast cells and its potential role in infection-associated inflammation This study aimed to investigate the expression and function of NOD1 in first trimester trophoblast cells, and evaluate the potential role of trophoblast cells in infection-associated inflammation NOD1 may have a role in mediating infection-associated inflammation. Once iE-DAP is recognized by NOD1, the inflammatory response may be induced via NOD1-RICK-NF-κB-mediated pathways. NOD1/2(-/-) mice were protected from HFD-induced inflammation, lipid accumulation, and peripheral insulin intolerance. In contrast, Nod1 gene-deficient mice developed enhanced joint inflammation with concomitant elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and cartilage damage, consistent with a model in which Nod1 controls the inflammatory reaction. These data indicate that the NLR family members Nod1 and Nod2 have different functions in controlling inflammation, and that intracellular Nod1-Nod2 interactions may determine the severity of arthritis in this experimental model. Whereas the lymphotoxin pathway was critical for the induction of the B cell chemoattractant CXCL13 in response to Nod1 agonists, B cell accumulation within the spleen following Nod1-induced systemic inflammation was independent of the lymphotoxin pathway. The effect of NOD1 and NOD2 activation on inflammation and the insulin signalling pathway was also assessed. Nonetheless, the role of NOD1 in intraocular inflammation has not been explored. A key role for the endothelium in NOD1 mediated vascular inflammation: comparison to TLR4 responses. We previously demonstrated that human first-trimester trophoblasts express Nod1 and Nod2, which trigger inflammation upon stimulation. In addition, recent studies have revealed a role for intracellular NOD1 receptors in the regulation of vascular inflammation and metabolism. In conclusion, the present findings describe an important role for NOD1 in the development of insulin resistance and inflammation in pregnancies complicated by GDM. Phenotyping of Nod1/2 double deficient mice and characterization of Nod1/2 in systemic inflammation and associated renal disease. Nod1 activation by bacterial iE-DAP induces maternal-fetal inflammation and preterm labor. The nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain (NOD) intracellular molecules recognise a wide range of microbial products, as well as other intracellular danger signals, thereby initiating inflammation through activation of nuclear factor κB (NFκB).  Nod1 ligands induce site-specific vascular inflammation. The nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) intracellular molecules recognize a wide range of microbial products as well as other intracellular danger signals, thereby initiating inflammation through activation of nuclear factor KB (NFKB), a central regulator of the terminal processes of human labor and delivery.  CONCLUSIONS: We identify NOD proteins as innate immune components that are involved in diet-induced inflammation and insulin intolerance.  Nod1 and Nod2 regulation of inflammation in the Salmonella colitis model. In particular, muramyl peptides trigger inflammation, contribute to host defense against microbial infections, and modulate the adaptive immune response to antigens.  Systemic and tissue-specific inflammation was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in NOD ligand-injected mice.  CONCLUSIONS: We identify NOD proteins as innate immune components that are involved in diet-induced inflammation and insulin intolerance. Acute activation of NOD proteins by mimetics of bacterial PGNs causes whole-body insulin resistance, bolstering the concept that innate immune responses to distinctive bacterial cues directly lead to insulin resistance.  Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), which is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine in intestinal mucosal inflammation, activates CARD4/NOD1 mRNA transcription in a time- and dose-dependent manner and results in augmentation of CARD4/NOD1 protein in SW480 cells. These studies suggest that the Th1 cytokine, IFN gamma, activates CARD4/NOD1 transcription and regulate innate immune mechanisms in the condition of intestinal mucosal inflammation. NOD1 activation triggers inflammation, In contrast to enhanced leptin mRNA by LPS and TNFα, NOD1 activation suppressed leptin mRNA in adipocytes, suggesting the differential effects of NOD1 activation in adipocytes.  Overall, our results suggest that NOD1 represents a novel target for adipose inflammation in obesity. NOD1 activation triggers inflammation, antimicrobial mechanisms and autophagy in both epithelial cells and murine macrophages. NOD1 is an intracellular immune receptor that senses peptidoglycan from Gram-negative bacteria and responds by inducing autophagy and activating NF-κB, leading to inflammation-mediated bacterial clearance; however chronic pathogens can evade NOD1-mediated clearance by altering peptidoglycan structure. Bacterial NOD1 activation is positioned as a component of metabolic endotoxemia that can contribute to hyperlipidemia, systemic inflammation and insulin resistance by acting directly on adipocytes. NOD1 ligand also caused inflammation and insulin resistance directly in primary hepatocytes from WT, but not NOD1(-/-), mice. We conclude that NOD1 activation reduced AHR in allergen-induced lung inflammation, which was accompanied by a reduction of allergen-specific T-cell proliferation. The effect of NOD1 and NOD2 activation on inflammation and the insulin signalling pathway was also assessed. Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), which is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine in intestinal mucosal inflammation, activates CARD4/NOD1 mRNA transcription in a time- and dose-dependent manner and results in augmentation of CARD4/NOD1 protein in SW480 cells.	yes
237	532c169ed6d3ac6a3400001f	Are there plasma membrane receptors for thyroid hormones?	ntegrins are heterodimeric structural components of the plasma membrane whose ligands include a large number of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins.  Recently, integrin αvβ3 has been shown to have a panel of previously unappreciated small molecule receptor sites for thyroid hormone and hormone analogues, for dihydrotestosterone, and for resveratrol, a polyphenol that has certain estrogen-like features. The integrin receptor activation by T4 may take a role in plasma membrane processes involved in the male reproductive system. Rapid signaling via this plasma membrane binding site appears to be responsible for many nongenomic effects of thyroid hormones, independent of the classic nuclear receptors.	yes
264	56c1d85eef6e394741000035	Is there association of matrix metalloproteinases with behaviour of pituitary adenomas?	While detailed histological subtyping remains the best independent predictor of aggressive behavior in the majority of cases, evidence suggests that the additional analyses of FGFR4, MMP, PTTG, Ki-67, p53, and deletions in chromosome 11 may contribute to decisions concerning management of aggressive pituitary adenomas. We observed elevation of MMP-2 and -9 expression and consequent 3-D cell invasion in cells under-expressing RECK.   Based on the significance of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) for tumor growth and angiogenesis, we have studied the effect of batimastat (BB-94), a synthetic MMPs inhibitor (MMPI) on the progression of prolactin-secreting pituitary adenoma in rats.  Inhibition of estrogen-induced pituitary tumor growth and angiogenesis in Fischer 344 rats by the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor batimastat. The results of our study provide evidence for an inhibitory effect of batimastat, a synthetic MMPI, on the growth and angiogenesis in an experimental model of human prolactinoma. In summary, the differential expression of extracellular matrix components, integrins and matrix metalloproteinase contributes to the control of pituitary hormone production and cell proliferation during tumorigenesis. Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. MMP-9).  We found no correlation of MMP-9 expression and tumour invasion. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes. CONCLUSIONS: TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 may play a key role in invasive pituitary adenomas to biological behavior. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-containing endopeptidases that are able to degrade the extracellular matrix and allow angiogenesis and tumor invasion.  MMP-9 expression did not differ between noninvasive tumors and normal pituitary gland, or between different sized prolactinomas. MMP-9 expression was related to aggressive tumor behavior. It was higher in invasive macroprolactinomas (P = 0.003) when compared with noninvasive macroprolactinomas or the normal anterior pituitary gland. In addition, although there was no difference in whether MMP-9 was present or not when nonfunctioning adenomas that recurred were compared with those that did not, samples of recurrent tumor at the second presentation were more likely to express MMP-9 (P = 0.01). Pituitary carcinomas were significantly more likely to be MMP-9 positive compared with normal anterior pituitary gland (P = 0.05), but there was no difference from invasive adenomas. Angiogenesis assessed by vascular density was related to MMP-9 expression (P<0.05). In summary, we have shown the presence of MMP-9 expression in some invasive and recurrent pituitary adenomas, and in the majority of pituitary carcinoma. The mechanisms whereby MMP-9 expression influences tumor recurrence and invasiveness, and its association with angiogenesis, remains to be elucidated.  Beside the digestion of the extracellular matrix during tumor invasion and metastasis, more recently, new functions for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been proposed.  CONCLUSION: No correlation could be established between the invasive potential of tumors and MMP-1, -2, and -3 expression levels.  Matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 expression correlated with cavernous sinus invasion of pituitary adenomas. Data on the dural invasiveness of pituitary adenomas have been correlated to the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (e.g. We found surprisingly high levels of MMP activity and low levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, indicating a high level of extracellular matrix-degrading activity in pituitary adenomas. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their nature inhibitors-the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) may play a central role in these processes.  We found surprisingly high levels of MMP activity and low levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases, indicating a high level of extracellular matrix-degrading activity in pituitary adenomas. There was an association between the invasion of pituitary adenomas and Ki-67 LI (P = 0.039) or the expression of VEGF (P &lt; 0.001) and MMP-9 (P &lt; 0.001). But c-myc LI and bcl-2 expression have no association with invasiveness of pituitary adenomas (P = 0.061 vs. nm23 and MMP-9 have associations with invasiveness of pituitary adenomas, Matrix metalloproteinase secreted by pituitary cells can release growth factors from the extracellular matrix that, in turn, control pituitary cell proliferation and hormone secretion. In summary, the differential expression of extracellular matrix components, integrins and matrix metalloproteinase contributes to the control of pituitary hormone production and cell proliferation during tumorigenesis. There was an association between the invasion of pituitary adenomas and Ki-67 LI (P = 0.039) or the expression of VEGF (P &lt; 0.001) and MMP-9 (P &lt; 0.001). Although our study has shown that MVD and the expression of VEGF, Ki-67, nm23 and MMP-9 have associations with invasiveness of pituitary adenomas, they are lack of specificity.	yes
270	56c6f6005795f9a73e000009	Are piRNAs involved in gene silencing?	"In Drosophila ovaries, the nuclear Piwi protein is required for transcriptional silencing of transposons, though the precise mechanisms by which this occurs are unknown. Here we show that the CG9754 protein is a component of Piwi complexes that functions downstream of Piwi and its binding partner, Asterix, in transcriptional silencing. Enforced tethering of CG9754 to nascent messenger RNA transcripts causes cotranscriptional silencing of the source locus and the deposition of repressive chromatin marks. We have named CG9754 ""Panoramix,"" and we propose that this protein could act as an adaptor, scaffolding interactions between the piRNA pathway and the general silencing machinery that it recruits to enforce transcriptional repression. piRNA-guided slicing of transposon transcripts enforces their transcriptional silencing via specifying the nuclear piRNA repertoire Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs interact with both transposon and nontransposon mRNAs to initiate sustained silencing via the RNAi pathway. To assess the dysregulation of gene silencing caused by lack of piRNAs, we restored RNA silencing in RNAi-defective animals in the presence or absence of piRNAs. Thus, by reanimating RNAi, we uncovered a role for piRNAs in protecting essential genes from RNA silencing. In different organisms, small RNAs were shown to be implicated in the posttranscriptional degradation of mRNA and/or transcriptional repression of the homologous locus. In Drosophila, the mechanism of piRNA-mediated silencing is still far from being understood Analyses of piRNA-mediated transcriptional transposon silencing in Drosophila Transcriptional silencing implies a piRNA-mediated formation of repressive chromatin which diminishes the transcriptional capacity of the target locus. In mice, piRNA-guided transposon repression correlates with establishment of CpG DNA methylation on their sequences, yet the mechanism and the spectrum of genomic targets of piRNA silencing are unknown Using a candidate gene KD-approach, we identified differences in the spatio-temporal requirements of the piRNA pathway components for piRNA-mediated silencing. Spatio-temporal requirements for transposable element piRNA-mediated silencing during Drosophila oogenesis In contrast, piRNA-mediated silencing is strong in germline stem cells in which TE mobilization is tightly repressed ensuring the continued production of viable germline cysts. Piwi induces piRNA-guided transcriptional silencing and establishment of a repressive chromatin state. In germ cells, early embryos, and stem cells of animals, PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) have an important role in silencing retrotransposons, which are vicious genomic parasites, through transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Our results show that the piRNA pathway can be used as a tool for sequence-specific gene silencing in germ cells and support the idea that the piRNA generating regions serve as traps for retrotransposons, enabling the host cell to generate piRNAs against active retrotransposons.  Our observations confirm the pivotal role of piRNA-mediated silencing in defending the genome against selfish transposition, yet also suggest limits to the optimization of host genome defense. Analysis of piRNA-mediated silencing of active TEs in Drosophila melanogaster suggests limits on the evolution of host genome defense The Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway defends animal genomes against the harmful consequences of transposable element (TE) infection by imposing small-RNA-mediated silencing. A novel organelle, the piNG-body, in the nuage of Drosophila male germ cells is associated with piRNA-mediated gene silencing. Proteins of the PIWI subfamily Aub and AGO3 associated with the germline-specific perinuclear granules (nuage) are involved in the silencing of retrotransposons and other selfish repetitive elements in the Drosophila genome.  Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the targets of piRNA-mediated silencing Mechanism of the piRNA-mediated silencing of Drosophila telomeric retrotransposons. Gene silencing mechanisms mediated by Aubergine piRNA complexes in Drosophila male gonad. The epigenetic trans-silencing effect in Drosophila involves maternally-transmitted small RNAs whose production depends on the piRNA pathway and HP1. Here, we show that mutations in squash and zucchini, which are involved in the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) silencing pathway, strongly affect TSE MVH in piRNA processing and gene silencing of retrotransposons piRNA-mediated silencing in Drosophila germlines. These have shed light not only on the molecular mechanisms of gene silencing mediated by piRNAs and PIWI proteins, but also on their intriguing relationship with cellular genes that have been shown to be important for gametogenesis and fertility. The most abundant piRNAs were those corresponding to antisense transcripts of Suppressor of Stellate [Su(Ste)] genes known to be involved in Stellate gene silencing To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in gene regulation PIWI-interacting small non-coding RNAs (piRNAs) are genetic and epigenetic regulatory factors in germline cells, where they maintain genome stability, are involved in RNA silencing and regulate gene expression The piNG-body contains ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in piRNA-silencing of genome repeats including transposons in premeiotic spermatocytes with aid of short piRNAs Our results show that the piRNA pathway can be used as a tool for sequence-specific gene silencing in germ cells and support the idea that the piRNA generating regions serve as traps for retrotransposons, enabling the host cell to generate piRNAs against active retrotransposons Recent studies have revealed not only the biogenesis of piRNAs and their roles in transposon silencing, but also the function of the Piwi-piRNA pathway in epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression A growing number of studies on piRNAs have investigated piRNA-mediated gene silencing, including piRNA biogenesis These have shed light not only on the molecular mechanisms of gene silencing mediated by piRNAs and PIWI proteins, but also on their intriguing relationship with cellular genes that have been shown to be important for gametogenesis and fertility Telomeric retroelements HeT-A, TART and TAHRE, which are involved in telomere maintenance in Drosophila, are also the targets of piRNA-mediated silencing.  MVH in piRNA processing and gene silencing of retrotransposons. To determine the capacity of piRNA-mediated silencing, we introduced reporter genes into Drosophila OSS cells, which express microRNAs (miRNAs) and piRNAs, and compared the Piwi pathway to the Argonaute pathway in gene regulation.  Therefore piRNA-mediated transcriptional mode of silencing is involved in the control of retrotransposon expression in the Drosophila germline. Panoramix enforces piRNA-dependent cotranscriptional silencing. The most abundant piRNAs were those corresponding to antisense transcripts of Suppressor of Stellate [Su(Ste)] genes known to be involved in Stellate gene silencing. Our results indicate that piRNAs are involved in a posttranscriptional gene-silencing mechanism resulting in RNA nuclear accumulation."	yes

276	53353927d6d3ac6a34000043	Are there any HCV replication inhibitors available?	We report here the discovery of the first small-molecule HCV infectivity inhibitor, GS-563253, also called HCV infectivity inhibitor 1 (HCV II-1).  Resistance to mericitabine (prodrug of HCV NS5B polymerase inhibitor PSI-6130) is rare and conferred by the NS5B S282T mutation. We tested the ability of NA808 to inhibit SPT's enzymatic activity in FLR3-1 replicon cells The SPT inhibitor NA808 prevents replication of HCV genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, and 4a in cultured hepatocytes and in mice with humanized livers. Vaniprevir (phase III clinical trials) and MK-5172 (phase II clinical trials) are two potent antiviral compounds that target NS3/4A protease treatment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been significantly improved with the approval of the first two HCV NS3/4A protease inhibitors, telaprevir (Incivek) and boceprevir (Victrelis).  Combination therapy with telaprevir and BMS-788329 (NS5A inhibitor) reduced serum HCV RNA to undetectable levels. The presence of an NS3-V36A telaprevir resistance mutation resulted in poor response to telaprevir monotherapy but showed significant HCV reduction when telaprevir was combined with BMS-788329. However, a BMS-788329-resistant strain emerged at low frequency. Infection with a BMS-788329-resistant NS5A-L31V mutation rapidly resulted in gain of an additional NS5A-Y93A mutation that conferred telaprevir resistance during combination therapy HCV NS5A replication complex inhibitors, exemplified by Daclatasvir (BMS-790052), represent a new class of DAA ACH-806 (or GS-9132) is a novel, small-molecule inhibitor specific for hepatitis C virus (HCV).  Telaprevir and boceprevir are the first two protease inhibitor (PI) DAAs to be approved for combination therapy with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV).  symmetrical bidentate structure of the NS5A inhibitor BMS-790052, a series of new monodentate molecules were designed In vitro, boceprevir is more active than telaprevir against the HCV G3 NS3/4A enzyme in cell-based and biochemical assays and against G3 isolates in replicon assays Alisporivir is the most advanced host-targeting antiviral in clinical development. Alisporivir blocks HCV replication by neutralizing the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity of the abundant host cytosolic protein, cyclophilin A Interestingly, the NS5A inhibitor daclatasvir (BMS-790052) caused a decrease in serum HCV RNA levels by about two orders of magnitude within 6 h of administration	yes
277	511a4ec01159fa8212000004	Is miR-21 related to carcinogenesis?	miR-21* and miR-203 were significantly dysregulated (P < 0.05) in PTC tissues with BRAFV600E. Expressions of miRNAs in papillary thyroid carcinoma and their associations with the BRAFV600E mutation. Levels of miRNA-21 (miR-21) and miR-106a in gastric cancer tissues were significantly higher compared with the levels in adjacent tissues (P = .006 and P = .001, respectively). Patients who had gastric cancer had significantly different levels of gastric juice miR-21 and miR-106a compared with patients who had benign gastric diseases (both P < .001). miR-21 levels in intestinal type gastric cancer specimens were higher than that in diffuse (P = .003) or mixed (P < .001) gastric cancer types. MiR-155 and miR-21 appeared significantly over-expressed in the colonic mucosa of IBD subjects without CRC, but also in neoplastic tissues of IBD patients compared to non-IBD controls (p<0.001). Importantly, in patients with IBD-CRCs, miR-155 and miR-21 over-expression extended to the distant non-neoplastic mucosa (p<0.001). Here we hypothesize that over-expression of miR-155 and miR-21, two inflammation-related miRNAs that target core MMR proteins, may constitute a pre-neoplastic event for the development of MSI IBD-CRCs. After administration, we determined the expressions of miR-21, miR-27a, miR-34a, miR-93, miR-143, miR-146a, miR-148a, miR-155, miR-196a, miR-203, miR-205, miR-221 and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B-cells-1 (Nfκb1), mitogen-activated protein kinase-8 (Mapk8) and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-ras) genes in the liver of mice. Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) is a tumor suppressor gene whose expression is controlled by miR-21. Consistently with PDCD4 downregulation, miR-21 was upregulated in neoplastic by comparison with nonneoplastic tissue samples. Expression of miR-21 (p=0.027), miR-181b (p=0.002), and miR-146b (p=0.021) in tumor tissue and miR-21 (p=0.003) in noncancerous tissue were associated with patients' overall survival. We analyzed the expression of nine miRNAs (miR-21, miR-127, miR-154, miR-224, miR-323, miR-370, miR-9*, miR-183, and miR-375) by quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction in 34 cases of sMTC, 6 cases of hMTC, and 2 cases of C-cell hyperplasia (CCH). MTC and CCH were both characterized by a significant overexpression of the whole set of miRNAs (the increase being 4.2-fold for miR-21, 6.7-fold for miR-127, 8.8-fold for miR-154, 6.6-fold for miR-224, 5.8-fold for miR-323, 6.1-fold for miR-370, 13-fold for miR-9*, 6.7-fold for miR-183, and 10.1 for miR-375, p<0.0001). The most frequent changes in miRNAs in CLL cells included downregulation of miR-126, miR-572, miR-494, miR-923, miR-638, miR-130a, miR-181a and miR-181b and up-regulation of miR-29a, miR-660, miR-20a, miR-106b, miR-142-5p, miR-101, miR-30b, miR-34a, miR-let-7f, miR-21 and miR-155. Results: MTC and CCH were both characterized by a significant overexpression of the whole set of miRNAs (the increase being 4.2-fold for miR-21, 6.7-fold for miR-127, 8.8-fold for miR-154, 6.6-fold for miR-224, 5.8-fold for miR-323 and 6.1-fold for miR-370, 13-fold for miR-9*, 6.7-fold for miR-183 and 10.1 for miR-375, p<0.0001). We found that the onco-miRNAs miR-21 and miR-221 displayed upregulated expression while the liver-specific miR-122 was downregulated. The aim of the present review was to describe the mechanisms of several known miR, summarize recent studies on oncogenic miR (e.g. miR-21, miR-106a and miR-17), tumor suppressor miR (e.g. miR-101, miR-181, miR-449, miR-486, let-7a) and controversial roles of miR (e.g. miR-107, miR-126) for gastric cancer. MiR-15b and miR-21 were differentially expressed in CSF samples from patients with gliomas, compared to control subjects with various neurologic disorders, including patients with primary CNS lymphoma and carcinomatous brain metastases. Moreover, inclusion of miR-15b and miR-21 in combined expression analyses resulted in an increased diagnostic accuracy with 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity to distinguish patients with glioma from control subjects and patients with primary CNS lymphoma. Many aberrantly expressed miRNAs were related to various cancers (e.g., miR-125b, hepatocellular carcinoma; miR-21, leukemia; miR-16, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; miR-192, pituitary adenomas; miR-199a-3p, ovarian cancer; miR-34a, pancreatic cancer). Several miRNAs (e.g., miR-34a, miR-21) and proteins (e.g., TGM2, NDRG2) that play crucial roles in liver tumorigenesis were first found to be affected by MC-LR in mouse liver. Except for miR-21 and miR-206, the expression levels of all miRNAs significantly changed during the progression of CaP. In addition, diet and carcinogen exposure modulated a number of microRNAs (miR-16, miR-19b, miR-21, miR26b, miR27b, miR-93, and miR-203) linked to canonical oncogenic signaling pathways. RESULTS: Elevated miR-21 (HR 2.06, 1.13-3.75), miR-17 (HR 2.00, 1.10-3.61), and miR-155 (HR 2.37, 1.27-4.42) was associated with worse cancer-specific mortality in the Maryland cohort. NF-κB targets miR-16 and miR-21 in gastric cancer: involvement of prostaglandin E receptors. Expression of miR-21, miR-29b, miR-34a/b/c, miR-155, and let-7a was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 639 IALT patients. hese two miRNAs have previously been identified as being overexpressed in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, with miR-21 specifically implicated in down-regulating the tumor suppressor gene, tropomyosin-1. MicroRNA-21 is involved in ionizing radiation-promoted liver carcinogenesis. We showed here that among several hundred miRNAs, miR-21 was the only one that increased 6 folds in high-LET IR-promoted mouse liver tumors when compared with that in the non-irradiated liver tissues. We also showed that miR-21 was up-regulated in human or mouse hepatocytes after exposure to IR, as well as in liver tissues derived from whole body irradiated mice. After the non-irradiated, low-LET or high-LET irradiated human hepatocytes were over-expressed with miR-21, these cells became tumorigenesis in nude mice. METHODS: We used this combined ISH/IHC assay to study a subset of cancer-associated miRNAs, including miRNAs frequently detected at low (miR-34a and miR-126) and high (miR-21 and miR-155) levels, in a panel of breast, colorectal, lung, pancreas, and prostate carcinomas. The miR-15a, miR-16, miR-143, miR-155, and miR-21 were upregulated in M059K, and the modulation of these miRNAs fluctuated in M059J cells in a time-dependent manner. Aberrantly increased expression of miR-21 plays a significant role in lung carcinogenesis and is a potential therapeutic target in both epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant and wild-type cases. Additionally, high miR-21 expression was associated with significantly decreased 5 year survival in patients (hazard ratio, 1.68; 95% CI: 1.04-2.77) in a model controlled for patient age, gender and tumor stage. ESULTS: In adenocarcinoma patients, miR-21, miR-223, miR-192, and miR-194 expression was elevated, whereas miR-203 expression was reduced in cancerous compared with noncancerous tissue. Significantly, elevated miR-21 expression in noncancerous tissue of SCC patients and reduced levels of miR-375 in cancerous tissue of adenocarcinoma patients with Barrett's were strongly associated with worse prognosis. miR-21, mir-31, miR-130a, miR-146b and miR-377 were consistently upregulated, whereas miR-1 and miR-143 were downregulated in lung tumors relative to normal lungs. In mice treated with VC and given I3C in the diet, levels of miR-21, mir-31, miR-130a, miR-146b and miR-377 were reduced relative to the level in mice treated with the carcinogen only. Further studies with miR-21 indicated that phosphatase and tensin homolog, programmed cell death 4 and rich protein with Kazal motifs are potential targets for the oncogenic effect of miR-21 and the chemopreventive activity of I3C. This study examines the potential clinical utility of an inflammatory gene expression signature as a prognostic biomarker for colon cancer in addition to previously examined miR-21 expression. CONCLUSIONS: IRS and miR-21 expression are independent predictors of colon cancer prognosis and may provide a clinically useful tool to identify high-risk patients. The most highly expressed miRNAs in gastric cancer tissues were miR-20b, miR-20a, miR-17, miR-106a, miR-18a, miR-21, miR-106b, miR-18b, miR-421, miR-340*, miR-19a and miR-658. Recent findings report their involvement in hair follicle morphogenesis (ablation of miRNAs from keratinocytes causes several defects, such as evagination instead of invagination), in psoriasis (skin-specific expression of miR-203 and psoriasisspecific expression of miR-146a, miR-21 and miR-125b in the skin), in autoimmune diseases affecting the skin, such as SLE and ITP, in wound healing (changes in the expression of specific miRNA at specific phases of the regeneration process), and in skin carcinogenesis (a novel miRNA signature that includes induction of miR-21, a candidate oncogenic miRNA). RESULTS: Several microRNAs were differentially expressed in serous ovarian carcinoma compared with normal ovarian tissues, including miR-21, miR-125a, miR-125b, miR-100, miR-145, miR-16, and miR-99a, which were each differentially expressed in >16 patients. Selected for validation were miR-20a, miR-21, miR-106a, miR-181b, and miR-203, and all 5 were enriched in tumors from the validation cohort (P < .001). Higher miR-21 expression was present in adenomas (P = .006) and in tumors with more advanced TNM staging (P < .001). In situ hybridization demonstrated miR-21 to be expressed at high levels in colonic carcinoma cells. To test this hypothesis, we studied the pharmacologic roles of three microRNAs previously implicated in cancer biology (let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21) and also used in silico methods to test pharmacologic microRNA effects more broadly. Changing the cellular levels of let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21 affected the potencies of a number of the anticancer agents by up to 4-fold. The effect was most prominent with mir-21, with 10 of 28 cell-compound pairs showing significant shifts in growth-inhibitory activity. Varying mir-21 levels changed potencies in opposite directions depending on compound class; indicating that different mechanisms determine toxic and protective effects. In silico comparison of drug potencies with microRNA expression profiles across the entire NCI-60 panel revealed that approximately 30 microRNAs, including mir-21, show highly significant correlations with numerous anticancer agents. Conversely, expression of other miRNAs was detected at varying levels predominantly within luminal epithelial cells in normal tissue; expression of miR-21 was frequently increased, whereas that of let-7a was decreased in malignant cells. We describe a novel EMT-specific microRNA signature that includes induction of miR-21, a candidate oncogenic microRNA associated with carcinogenesis. Notable was the high expression of miR-21 and miR-205. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key actors in carcinogenesis and we demonstrated that microRNA-21 (miR-21), oncomiR is expressed early during PDA. These results indicated that miR-21 plays a role in the carcinogenesis and metastasis of O. viverrini-associated CCA by suppressing the function of PDCD4. Importantly, in patients with IBD CRCs, miR-155 and miR-21 overexpression extended to the distant non-neoplastic mucosa (P < 0.001). Ectopic overexpression of miR-21 promoted Akt activation and phosphorylation of EZH2, whereas inhibiting miR-21 by transfecting the cells with anti-miR-21 inhibited Akt activation and EZH2 phosphorylation. PDCD4 nuclear down-regulation (which parallels miR-21 up-regulation) is involved in the molecular pathway of IBD-associated carcinogenesis. The expression levels of miR-21 (p = 0.027), miR-181b (p = 0.002) and miR-146b (p = 0.021) in tumor tissue and miR-21 (p = 0.003) in noncancerous tissue were associated with overall survival of patients. OBJECTIVE: As an important oncogenic miRNA, miR-21 has been reported to play crucial roles in glioblastoma (GBM) carcinogenesis. We further analyzed the expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21), an oncogenic noncoding RNA involved in oncogenic Ras signaling, by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) plays crucial roles in carcinogenesis and is considered as one of the most studied oncomiRNAs. Although microRNA-21 (miR-21) has been implicated in various aspects of carcinogenesis, its functions and molecular mechanisms in carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis are unclear. Substantial evidence indicates that microRNA-21 (miR-21) is a key oncomiR in carcinogenesis and is significantly elevated in multiple myeloma (MM). MicroRNA 21 (miR-21) has been implicated in various aspects of carcinogenesis. Conversely, pAkt and miR-21 expression was significantly up-regulated in the whole spectrum of preneoplastic/neoplastic lesions considered. Several miRNAs (e.g., miR-34a, miR-21) and proteins (e.g., TGM2, NDRG2) that play crucial roles in liver tumorigenesis were first found to be affected by MC-LR in mouse liver. RESULTS: Except for miR-21 and miR-206, the expression levels of all miRNAs significantly changed during the progression of CaP. MicroRNA 21 (miR-21) is overexpressed in virtually all types of carcinomas and various types of hematological malignancies. As expected, miR-21 expression was significantly upregulated in preneoplastic/neoplastic samples, consistent with PDCD4 downregulation. Furthermore, miR-21 levels in the primary tumours correlated with disease stage (P < 0.0001). We found that miR-16 and miR-21 were upregulated upon nicotine stimulation, transfection with anti-miR-16 or anti-miR-21 significantly abrogated cell proliferation. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is a unique miRNA in that it is overexpressed in most tumour types analysed so far. Although altered expressions of miR-21 and miR-34a were manifested within cancer cells, those of miR-126 and miR-155 were predominantly confined to endothelial cells and immune cells, respectively. However, the function of miR-21 in osteosarcoma is still unclear. In SCC patients, we found elevated miR-21 and reduced miR-375 expression levels in cancerous compared with noncancerous tissue. miR-21, mir-31, miR-130a, miR-146b and miR-377 were consistently upregulated, whereas miR-1 and miR-143 were downregulated in lung tumors relative to normal lungs. Precancerous adenomas also frequently showed miR-21 up-regulation. Higher miR-21 expression was present in adenomas (P = .006) Importantly, the inflammatory ZD esophagus had a distinct microRNA signature resembling human ESCC or tongue SCC miRNAomes with miR-31 and miR-21 as the top-up-regulated species. Several miRNAs have been recently reported to be involved in modulation of glioma development, especially some upregulated miRNAs, such as microRNA-21 (miR-21), which has been found to function as an oncogene in cultured glioblastoma multiforme cells. OBJECTIVE: MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is one of the miRNAs that are frequently and highly overexpressed in tumor tissue of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients; however, only a little is known about its functional role in CRC. Inhibition of microRNA-21 (mir‑21) induced upregulation of Spry2             and PTEN which underscores the importance of mir-21 in Spry2-associated tumorigenesis             of the colon. The microRNA miR-21, a known oncogenic miRNA, was found to be upregulated in papillary and clear cell carcinomas. Since microRNA-21 (miR-21) may contribute to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance in many cancer types, we aimed to investigate its efficacy in TCCs. Several miRNAs have been recently reported to be involved in modulation of glioma development, especially some up-regulated miRNAs, such as microRNA-21 (miR-21), which has been found to function as an oncogene in cultured glioblastoma multiforme cells. In this study, by using high-throughput microRNA profiling, we identified that two miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-148a) overexpressed in CD4+ T cells from both patients with lupus and lupus-prone MRL/lpr mice, which promote cell hypomethylation by repressing DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression. The microRNA-21 (miR-21) has been identified as the only miRNA overexpressed in a variety of cancers, including leukemia. OBJECTIVE: The contribution of overexpressed microRNA-21 and -221 (miR-21 and miR-221) to the malignant phenotype was determined by inhibiting these miRNAs using antisense oligonucleotides. The microRNA-21(miR-21) has been identified as the only miRNA over-expressed in a wide variety of cancers, including cervical cancer. To determine the functions of these microRNAs in lymphomagenesis, we examined the effects of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting miR-21 (ASO-21) and/or miR-155 (ASO-155) in NK-cell lymphoma lines overexpressing one or both of these miRNAs. In this study, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of 28 cases of never-smoker lung cancer identified aberrantly expressed miRNAs, which were much fewer than in lung cancers of smokers and included miRNAs previously identified (e.g., up-regulated miR-21) and unidentified (e.g., down-regulated miR-138) in those smoker cases. The oncogenic miRNA, microRNA-21 (miR-21), was found to be upregulated in laryngeal carcinoma tissues. OBJECTIVE: To better understand microRNA miR-21 function in carcinogenesis, we analyzed miR-21 expression patterns in different stages of colorectal cancer development using in situ hybridization (ISH). Of these miRNAs, miR-21 appears to be important in tumorigenesis given its up-regulation in almost all types of human cancer examined. The microRNA-21 gene (mir-21) has been identified as the only miRNA commonly overexpressed in solid tumors of the lung, breast, stomach, prostate, colon, brain, head and neck, esophagus and pancreas. RESULTS: Our data showed that a common pattern of microRNA expression distinguishes any tumor type from normal pancreas, suggesting that this set of microRNAs might be involved in pancreatic tumorigenesis; the expression of miR-103 and miR-107, associated with lack of expression of miR-155, discriminates tumors from normal; a set of 10 microRNAs distinguishes endocrine from acinar tumors and is possibly associated with either normal endocrine differentiation or endocrine tumorigenesis; miR-204 is primarily expressed in insulinomas and correlates with immunohistochemical expression of insulin; and the overexpression of miR-21 is strongly associated with both a high Ki67 proliferation index and presence of liver metastasis. To search for tumor-associated mutations that could affect processing and expression of mature miRNAs, a panel of 91 cancer-derived cell lines was analyzed for sequence variations in 15 miRNAs implicated in tumorigenesis by virtue of their known target transcripts (let-7 family targeting oncogenic Ras) or their localization to sites of frequent chromosomal instability (miR-143, miR-145, miR-26a-1, and miR-21).	yes
313	53380000d6d3ac6a34000059	Is poly (ADP- ribosylation) involved in transcriptional control?	Histone phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, SUMOylation and poly-ADP-ribosylation, as well as ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes, play equally pivotal roles in the maintenance of transcriptional fidelity oly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1; EC 2.4.2.30) is an abundant nuclear protein that is involved in DNA repair, cell cycle control, programmed cell death and transcriptional regulation. Many lines of evidence suggest that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (Parp-1) is involved in transcriptional regulation of various genes as a coactivator or a corepressor by modulating chromatin structure These results suggest that Parp-1 is required to maintain transcriptional regulation of a wide variety of genes on a genome-wide scale PARP-1 was identified as a part of the mH2A1.1 nucleosome complex and was found to be associated with the Hsp70.1 promoter Upon heat shock, the Hsp70.1 promoter-bound PARP-1 is released to activate transcription through ADP-ribosylation of other Hsp70.1 promoter-bound proteins Cycloheximide-induced cells were treated with two chemical inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. 3-Aminobenzamide inhibited 75% of PAP gene induction and 4-hydroxyquinazolone, the highly specific inhibitor of the enzyme, blocked almost completely PAP expression, suggesting that ADP-ribosylation was indeed required for the upregulation of PAP gene expression by cycloheximide  inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase suppressed UV-induced HIV-1 gene expression but not tat-mediated expression oly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors suppress UV-induced human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gene expression	yes
329	54f4627e64850a5854000007	Is micro RNA 1 (miR-1) implicated in cardiac arrhythmias?	Dysfunction of the gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43), an established miR-1 target, during cardiac hypertrophy leads to ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VT). miR-1 overexpression may contribute to the increased susceptibility of the heart to AVB, which provides us novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ischemic cardiac arrhythmias. The incidence of AVB was higher in miR-1 Tg mice than that in wild-type (WT) mice.  As miR-1 has been shown in animal models and clinical studies to contribute to arrhythmogenesis by regulating pacemaker channel genes, our finding of miR-1 up-regulation in patients with myocardial infarction indicates that it might be responsible for the higher risk for arrhythmias in these patients.  Lately, some highlight articles revealed that the altered expression of miRNAs such as miR-1, miR-133, miR-21, miR-208 etc in hearts also contributed to cardiovascular diseases, such as heart ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy, and arrhythmias. MicroRNA-1 (miR-1) reciprocally regulates inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir)2.1 expression in coronary disease, contributing to arrhythmogenesis.  miR-1 levels are greatly reduced in human AF, possibly contributing to up-regulation of Kir2.1 subunits, leading to increased I(K1). Because up-regulation of inward-rectifier currents is important for AF maintenance, these results provide potential new insights into molecular mechanisms of AF with potential therapeutic implications. The muscle-specific miR-1 has been implicated in cardiac hypertrophy, heart development, cardiac stem cell differentiation, and arrhythmias through targeting of regulatory proteins.  We conclude that the beta-adrenergic pathway can stimulate expression of arrhythmogenic miR-1, contributing to ischaemic arrhythmogenesis, and beta-blockers produce their beneficial effects partially by down-regulating miR-1, which might be a novel strategy for ischaemic cardioprotection. MiR-1 influences susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. Changes in abundance of muscle-specific microRNA, miR-1, have been implicated in cardiac disease, including arrhythmia and heart failure. In the presence of isoproterenol, rhythmically paced, miR-1-overexpressing myocytes exhibited spontaneous arrhythmogenic oscillations of intracellular Ca(2+), events that occurred rarely in control myocytes under the same conditions. Here we show that miR-1 is overexpressed in individuals with coronary artery disease, and that when overexpressed in normal or infarcted rat hearts, it exacerbates arrhythmogenesis. Elimination of miR-1 by an antisense inhibitor in infarcted rat hearts relieved arrhythmogenesis.  Thus, miR-1 may have important pathophysiological functions in the heart, and is a potential antiarrhythmic target.

341	531d34be267d7dd053000004	Has the presence of delayed enhancement been documented in athletes performing strenuous exercise?	Atypical findings such as marked cardiac dilation, reduced deformation, or small patches of delayed gadolinium enhancement may be commonly encountered in well-trained athletes, but, at present, the prognostic significance of such findings is unknown.  On CMR, DGE localized to the interventricular septum was identified in 5 of 39 athletes who had greater cumulative exercise exposure and lower RVEF (47.1 ± 5.9 vs. 51.1 ± 3.7%, P = 0.042) than those with normal CMR. Post-event cardiac MRI demonstrated the interval appearance of delayed enhancement of gadolinium at the inferior insertion of the right ventricle and in the interventricular septum-a novel finding that may represent subtle inflammation secondary to a combined exercise and altitude effect. No evidence of delayed enhancement of the left ventricular myocardium was found on CMR imaging, suggesting that the increase in cardiac biomarkers after the marathon may not have be due to myocardial necrosis. Of the 102 runners, five had a CAD pattern of LGE, and seven had a non-CAD pattern of LGE. The CAD pattern of LGE was located in the territory of the left anterior descending coronary artery more frequently than was the non-CAD pattern (P = .0027, Fisher exact test). The prevalence of LGE in runners was higher than that in age-matched control subjects (12% vs 4%; P = .077, McNemar exact test).	yes
346	54d901ec4b1fd0d33c000006	Does nimotuzumab improve survival of glioblastoma patients?	The survival times were similar to those seen in historical data of standard therapy. The survival time of a matched population treated at the same hospital with irradiation alone was decreased (median 8.0 and 12.2 mo for GBM and AA patients, respectively) compared with that of the patients who received nimotuzumab and curative-intent radiotherapy. This study, in a poor prognosis population, validates the previous data of survival gain after combining nimotuzumab and radiotherapy, in newly diagnosed high-grade glioma patients. The mean and median survival time for subjects treated with nimotuzumab was 31.06 and 17.76 vs. 21.07 and 12.63 months for the control group. CONCLUSIONS: In this randomized trial, nimotuzumab showed an excellent safety profile and significant survival benefit in combination with irradiation. Nimotuzumab was well-tolerated and treatment with the antibody yielded a survival benefit: median survival time was 32.66 mo and the 2-y survival rate was 54.2%. This study demonstrated the feasibility of prolonged administration of nimotuzumab and showed preliminary evidence of clinical benefit in HGG patients with poor prognosis.  Recent clinical studies show that patients with malignant gliomas could benefit from nimotuzumab treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Nimotuzumab in combination with chemotherapy has moderate activity in patients with malignant gliomas and the toxicities are well tolerable, therefore, worth further investigation. It has been evaluated in malignant brain tumors in adults and children, and shown to be therapeutically safe and effective in terms of increased survival and improved quality of life.  Conclusions As used in this study, nimotuzumab demonstrated a broad safety profile, making it acceptable for chronic use, and implied clinical benefits in terms of increased survival and improved functional status in these patients, compared to findings described in the literature.  Nimotuzumab prolongs survival in patients with malignant gliomas: A phase I/II clinical study of concomitant radiochemotherapy with or without nimotuzumab. Conclusions As used in this study, nimotuzumab demonstrated a broad safety profile, making it acceptable for chronic use, and implied clinical benefits in terms of increased survival and improved functional status in these patients, compared to findings described in the literature. This study, in a poor prognosis population, validates the previous data of survival gain after combining nimotuzumab and radiotherapy, in newly diagnosed high-grade glioma patients Conclusions As used in this study, nimotuzumab demonstrated a broad safety profile, making it acceptable for chronic use, and implied clinical benefits in terms of increased survival and improved functional status in these patients, compared to findings described in the literature A multicenter exploratory study combining nimotuzumab and radiotherapy showed disease control and an overall patient survival similar to previous experiences along with an improvement in the quality of patient survival and no severe side effects. Combining craniospinal irradiation (CSI) with concurrent temozolomide and nimotuzumab therapy may slightly improve tumor control and overall survival	yes
351	56e310a151531f7e33000017	Do RNA:DNA hybrids preferentially form in high or low GC regions?	Intrinsic termination signals for multisubunit bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) encode a GC-rich stem-loop structure followed by a polyuridine [poly(U)] tract, and it has been proposed that steric clash of the stem-loop with the exit pore of the RNAP imposes a shearing force on the RNA in the downstream RNA:DNA hybrid, resulting in misalignment of the active site We have observed that transcription through the GC-rich FMR1 5'UTR region favors R-loop formation, with the nascent (G-rich) RNA forming a stable RNA:DNA hybrid with the template DNA strand, thereby displacing the non-template DNA strand. Transcription termination by bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) occurs at sequences coding for a GC-rich RNA hairpin followed by a U-rich tract. We used single-molecule techniques to investigate the mechanism by which three representative terminators (his, t500, and tR2) destabilize the elongation complex (EC). In the 5' flanking region, nucleotides -234 to -213 encompass a GC-rich region which exhibits high homology (greater than 70%) to the 5' flanking regions of the genes of all the apolipoproteins published to date, namely, apo-A-II (-497 to -471), apo-A-I (approximately -196 to -179), apo-E (-409 to -391), and apo-C-III (approximately -116 to -103). Recently, we demonstrated that cotranscriptional RNA•DNA hybrids are preferentially formed at GC-rich trinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat sequences in vitro as well as in human genomic DNA. Considering the extent of transcription through the human genome as well as the abundance of GC-rich and/or non-canonical DNA structure forming tandem repeats, RNA•DNA hybrids may represent a common mutagenic conformation. Recently, we demonstrated that cotranscriptional RNA•DNA hybrids are preferentially formed at GC-rich trinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeat sequences in vitro as well as in human genomic DNA. 	yes
352	56a292ae496b62f23f000001	Are shadow enhancers associated with development?	"Critical developmental control genes sometimes contain ""shadow"" enhancers that can be located in remote positions, including the introns of neighboring genes These results suggest that shadow enhancers represent a novel mechanism of canalization whereby complex developmental processes ""bring about one definite end-result regardless of minor variations in conditions"" Shadow enhancers flanking the HoxB cluster direct dynamic Hox expression in early heart and endoderm development.  This suggests that they function as shadow enhancers to modulate the expression of genes from the HoxB complex during cardiac development. Regulatory analysis of the HoxA complex reveals that it also has enhancers in the 3' flanking region which contain RAREs and have the potential to modulate expression in endoderm and heart tissues This suggests that they function as shadow enhancers to modulate the expression of genes from the HoxB complex during cardiac development. Recent reports have shown that developmental genes often possess multiple discrete enhancer modules that drive transcription in similar spatio-temporal patterns: primary enhancers located near the basal promoter and secondary, or 'shadow', enhancers located at more remote positions. Together, the similarities in their location, enhancer output, and dependence on retinoid signaling suggest that a conserved cis-regulatory cassette located in the 3' proximal regions adjacent to the HoxA and HoxB complexes evolved to modulate Hox gene expression during mammalian cardiac and endoderm development.  This suggests that they function as shadow enhancers to modulate the expression of genes from the HoxB complex during cardiac development."	yes
388	56c313d150c68dd416000002	Does nifedipine inhibit L-type calcium channels?	Nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, reduced the expression of synaptogamin and syntaxin and blocked the suppressive effect of vecuronium, suggesting that both agents inhibit presynaptic L-type calcium channels. Treatment with nifedipine to inhibit calcium influx via the L-type channel Cav1.2 (alpha(1C)) inhibited the TGFbeta stimulated increase in ANK expression at all phases of chondrogenesis. Finally, we found that PKCepsilon-induced stellation was significantly reduced by the specific L-type channel blocker nifedipine, indicating that calcium influx through VGCC mediates the change in astrocyte morphology induced by PKCepsilon. However, APV and nifedipine, an inhibitor of L-type calcium channels, failed to inhibit LTP when administered following the slow increase in ethanol. Both the metallic ions Cd2+ and Ni2+, known to inhibit voltage-gated calcium channels and T-type channels, respectively, and verapamil and nifedipine, typical blocker of L-type calcium channels completely prevented the hypoxic neuronal NO generation. Further, the L-type calcium channel blocker, nifedipine, was able to inhibit the initial increase in [Ca2+]i, suggesting that at least this phase of the TMT effect was mediated by calcium channels, although nifedipine had no significant effect on the time to reach the maximal [Ca2+]i level Treatment with omega-conotoxin GVIA (3 microM) or nifedipine (10 microM) to inhibit Ca(2+) influx through N- or L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs), respectively, also decreased the rate of AP repolarization and increased AP duration Concentrations of nifedipine (10 microM) and nimodipine (3 microM) that maximally inhibit L-type calcium channels reduced the sI(AHP) by 30 and 50%, respectively Consequently, it was demonstrated in the present study that nimodipine and nitrendipine inhibit both L- and N-type calcium channels and thus seem to be unique among the dihydropyridines examined in their effects on calcium channels in dibutyryl cAMP-differentiated neuroblastoma x glioma hybrid NG 108-15 cells, whereas nifedipine and niguldipine appear to block mainly L-type calcium channels However, APV and nifedipine, an inhibitor of L-type calcium channels, failed to inhibit LTP when administered following the slow increase in ethanol Calcium-channel antagonists, omega-conotoxin GVIA (omega-CgTx GVIA; N-type), nifedipine (L-type), and omega-conotoxin MVIIC (omega-CmTx MVIIC; P/Q type), were used to characterize the voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels (VOCCs) involved in this release The T- and L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) mibefradil attenuates leg edema induced by the L-type CCB nifedipine in the spontaneously hypertensive rat: a novel differentiating assay. L-type calcium channel antagonist nifedipine reduces neurofilament restitution following traumatic optic nerve injury. Nifedipine, an L-type calcium channel blocker, restores the hypnotic response in rats made tolerant to the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine. Comparison of L-type calcium channel blockade by nifedipine and/or cadmium in guinea pig ventricular myocytes. Nifedipine inhibits picrotoxin-induced seizure activity: further evidence on the involvement of L-type calcium channel blockers in epilepsy.	yes
391	517a8a718ed59a060a00003e	Does triiodothyronine stimulate red blood cell sodium potassium pump?	reduction in Na+,K+ATPase activity has been demonstrated in red blood cells (RBCs), as well as an inverse correlation between this enzymatic action and free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels. The restoration of normal FT3 values also brings about a normalization of Na+,K+ATPase activity in erythrocytes. at hyperthyroid patients have decreased red cell Na/K-ATPase activity and provide direct evidence that erythrocyte ATPase activity is increased in hypothyroid patients. The change in enzyme activity in patients with nonthyroidal illness and decreased circulating T3 levels was comparable to that in hypothyroidism. The effect of triiodothyronine (T3) on Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of K562 human erythroleukemic cell was studied to understand why the erythrocyte sodium pump activity is decreased in hyperthyroidism. We conclude that T3 stimulates Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity of K562 cells and in the presence of T3 during differentiation, the enzyme activity remains high.	no
426	5522fadb7b523f2123000001	Are Notch mutations related to T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL)?	Notch receptors participate in a highly conserved signalling pathway that regulates normal development and tissue homeostasis in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Deregulated Notch signalling has been implicated in many diseases, but the clearest example of a pathogenic role is found in T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (T-LL), in which the majority of human and murine tumours have acquired mutations that lead to aberrant increases in Notch1 signalling. NOTCH proteins (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4) play crucial roles in embryonic development. Also, mounting evidence indicates that NOTCH contributes to the pathogenesis of hematopoietic and solid malignancies. Recent studies reported a high incidence of gain-of-function mutations of the NOTCH1 gene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL).  Our data indicate that NOTCH1 is mutated in T-ALL, but not in other common human cancers, and that NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTH4 genes are rarely mutated in common human cancers.  The Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in maintaining the balance between cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and is a highly conserved signaling pathway that regulates normal development in a context- and dose-dependent manner. Dysregulation of Notch signaling has been suggested to be key events in a variety of hematological malignancies. Notch1 signaling appears to be the central oncogenic trigger in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), in which the majority of human malignancies have acquired mutations that lead to constitutive activation of Notch1 signaling. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is characterized as a high-risk stratified disease associated with frequent relapse, chemotherapy resistance, and a poorer prognostic outlook than B-precursor ALL. Many of the challenges in treating T-ALL reflect the lack of prognostic cytogenetic or molecular abnormalities on which to base therapy, including targeted therapy. Notch1 activating mutations were identified in more than 50% of T-ALL cases and can be therapeutically targeted with γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs).  Notch1 is a transmembrane receptor that is frequently mutated in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL) is characterized by aberrant activation of NOTCH1 in over 60% of T-ALL cases. The high prevalence of activating NOTCH1 mutations highlights the critical role of NOTCH signaling in the pathogenesis of this disease and has prompted the development of therapeutic approaches targeting the NOTCH signaling pathway.  Activating mutations in NOTCH1, an essential regulator of T cell development, are frequently found in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).  NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients. Mutations in NOTCH1/FBXW7 activate NOTCH signaling and are of prognostic significance in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling. Activation of the Notch pathway occurs commonly in T acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) because of mutations in Notch1 or Fbw7 and is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patients frequently display NOTCH1 activating mutations and Notch can transcriptionally down-regulate the tumor suppressor PTEN. The identification of activating mutations in NOTCH1 in over 50% of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) has generated major interest in the elucidation of the mechanisms of transformation downstream of oncogenic NOTCH and in the targeting of the NOTCH signaling pathway in this disease. BACKGROUND: In T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL), activating mutations of NOTCH1 are observed in more than 50% of cases, whereas the t(7;9)(q34;q34) involving NOTCH1 at 9q34 and TRB@ at 7q34 is an extremely rare but recurrent translocation. Activating mutations in NOTCH1 consitute the most prominent genetic abnormality in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive cancer that is frequently associated with activating mutations in NOTCH1 and dysregulation of MYC The Notch signaling pathway has been recognized as a key factor for the pathogenesis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), because of the high incidence of activating mutations of Notch1 Notch signaling is of crucial importance in normal T-cell development and Notch 1 is frequently mutated in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), leading to aberrantly high Notch signaling NOTCH signaling pathway is essential in T-cell development and NOTCH1 mutations are frequently present in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) Activating Notch-1 mutations are frequent in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), occurring in >50% of patients Gain-of-function mutations in Notch-1 have been reported in more than 50% of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL)	yes
436	56c30ce99d3e5f1412000002	Is the protein KCNQ2 associated with idiopathic epilepsy?	Juvenile idiopathic epilepsy (JIE) in Arabian foals resembles benign-familial neonatal convulsion (BFNC) syndrome, a rare idiopathic epilepsy of new-born humans. BFNC syndrome exhibits genetic heterogeneity, as has been hypothesised to occur in Arabian foals, and is known to be caused by mutations in the voltage-gated potassium channel subunit KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes. They also demonstrate that sequence variations of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes may contribute to the etiology of common IE syndromes. The underlying genetic abnormalities of rare familial idiopathic epilepsy have been identified, such as mutation in KCNQ2, a K(+) channel gene. Sequence variations of the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes may contribute to the etiology of common idiopathic epilepsy syndromes. This paper summarizes recent findings concerning sodium (SCN1A) and potassium channel (KCNQ2 and KCNQ3) dysfunctions in the pathogenesis of rare and common idiopathic epilepsies (IE).  Mutations in the SCN1A gene are found in up to 80% of individuals with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), and mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were identified in benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC) as well as in single families with Rolandic epilepsy (RE) and idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE). The involvement of KCNQ2 (Kv7.2) and KCNQ3 (Kv7.3) in a benign idiopathic neonatal epilepsy, KCNQ4 (Kv7.4) in a form of congenital deafness, and the discovery that neuronal KCNQ heteromultimers were among the molecular substrates of M-channels, resulted in a high level of interest for potential drug development strategies Mutations in the SCN1A gene are found in up to 80% of individuals with severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI), and mutations in KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 were identified in benign familial neonatal convulsions (BFNC) as well as in single families with Rolandic epilepsy (RE) and idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) The functional interaction between KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 provides a framework for understanding how mutations in either channel can cause a form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy Mutations in KCNQ2- or KCNQ3-encoding genes cause benign familiar neonatal convulsions (BFNCs), a rare autosomal-dominant idiopathic epilepsy of the newborn Mutations in KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 that reduce the M-current are responsible for benign familial neonatal seizures, a rare autosomal dominant idiopathic epilepsy of the newborn These include benign familial neonatal convulsions due to mutations in KCNQ2 or KCNQ3, generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus due to mutations in SCN1A, SCN2A, SCN1B, and GABRG2, autosomal-dominant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) due to a mutation in GABRA1 and mutations in CLCN2 associated with several IGE sub-types KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 mutations contribute to different idiopathic epilepsy syndromes Role of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes in juvenile idiopathic epilepsy in Arabian foals Mutations in the voltage gated potassium channel gene KCNQ2 and the homologous gene KCNQ3 have been found to cause a rare monogenic subtype of idiopathic generalized epilepsy, the benign familial neonatal convulsions Role of KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 genes in juvenile idiopathic epilepsy in Arabian foals.

It appears that intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and trace element deficiency could explain the extensive emergence of chronic Botulism. The patient was treated with human botulism immune globulin and had rapid recovery in weakness. A stool sample from the patient was positive for Type A Clostridium botulinum toxin eventually confirming the diagnosis of infant botulism The botulism immunoglobulin was administered, and a diagnosis was confirmed with positive botulinum toxin in the stool samples. Full recovery was made by the infant Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) serotype B (BoNT/B) is one of the serotypes of BoNT that causes deadly human botulism, though it is used clinically for treatment of many neuromuscular diseases. Foodborne botulism is a rare and sometimes fatal illness caused by consuming foods containing botulinum neurotoxin To assess the effectiveness and safety of botulinum toxin in treating MPS, excluding MPS in neck and head muscles. Botulinum toxin (BTX) is one of the most potent bacterial toxins known and its effectiveness in the treatment of some pain syndromes is well known.  An emerging treatment option to address these issues is the use of a paralyzing material such as botulinum toxin A (Botox) to decrease the appearance of the wrinkles, which yields a more esthetic and youthful facial appearanc lthough BoNT is an extremely toxic molecule, it is now increasingly used for the treatment of disorders related to muscle hyperactivity and glandular hyperactivity.	no
451	588fa4b9ed9bbee70d000006	Is ocrelizumab effective for treatment of multiple sclerosis?	 Advances made in immunomodulation are driving the progress being made in the treatment of MS. Ocrelizumab is the first treatment with positive results in the primarily progressive forms and tocilizumab, a drug product for rheumatoid arthritis, stands out as a potential candidate for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica.  Expert commentary: The recent encouraging results of the ocrelizumab trial in PP MS, the first to reach the primary disability endpoint, indicate B cells as a promising therapeutic target to prevent disease progression.  Ocrelizumab also shows efficacy in the primary progressive form of multiple sclerosis. Ocrelizumab for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Expert commentary: The topline results of two phase-III randomized clinical trials demonstrate superiority of ocrelizumab over interferon beta in RRMS patients with regards to clinical and paraclinical outcome parameters.  The efficacy of three of them, rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab in MS has been confirmed by placebo-controlled clinical trials demonstrating a significant reduction of the annualized relapsing rate (ARR), new gadolinium-enhancing (GdE) and T2 lesions.  Ongoing PMS trials are currently being conducted with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor ibudilast, S1P modulator siponimod and anti-B-cell therapy ocrelizumab.  RECENT FINDINGS: Novel and imminently emerging DMTs for the treatment of RRMS include alemtuzumab, daclizumab, ocrelizumab, pegylated interferon-β-1a, and three times weekly glatiramer acetate.  To summarize mechanisms of action, efficacy, and safety of novel and imminently emerging disease-modifying treatments (DMTs) intended to be used in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).Novel and imminently emerging DMTs for the treatment of RRMS include alemtuzumab, daclizumab, ocrelizumab, pegylated interferon-β-1a, and three times weekly glatiramer acetate Ocrelizumab in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a phase 2, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of two dose regimens of the humanised anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.  In multiple sclerosis (MS), B cell-depleting therapy using monoclonal anti-CD20 Abs, including rituximab (RTX) and ocrelizumab, effectively reduces disease activity.  Ocrelizumab also shows efficacy in the primary progressive form of multiple sclerosis.Most of the presented cell-depleting and myeloablative therapies are highly effective treatment options but are also accompanied by significant risks. The armamentarium of approved disease-modifying therapies in MS and those in development include: (1) the first approved, moderately effective, injectable interferon-β and glatiramer acetate; (2) oral drugs (fingolimod, laquinimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate); (3) monoclonal antibodies (rituximab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, daclizumab, alemtuzumab); and (4) immunosuppressive agents (e.g. mitoxantrone).

A 60-kDa glucosamine binding lectin, white kidney bean lectin (WKBL), was purified from Phaseolus vulgaris cv. white kidney beans, by application of anion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, and FPLC-size exclusion on Superdex 75. The anti-proliferative activity of WKBL on HONE1 cells and HepG2 cells was stronger than the activity on MCF7 cells and WRL68 cells  Treatment of human stomach cancer KATO III cells with hot-water extracts from adzuki beans led to their growth inhibition as well as apoptosis induction. Stimulation of dendritic cell maturation and induction of apoptosis in leukemia cells by a heat-stable extract from azuki bean (Vigna angularis), a promising immunopotentiating food and dietary supplement for cancer prevention. Human gut flora-fermented nondigestible fraction from cooked bean ( Phaseolus vulgaris L.) modifies protein expression associated with apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and proliferation in human adenocarcinoma colon cancer cells. This paper reports the effect of fermentation products (FP) by hgf (FP-hgf) from NDF of cooked beans on survival and protein expression associated with apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and proliferation in human adenocarcinoma colon cancer cells. PHA-E is a natural product extracted from red kidney beans, and it has been reported to induce cell apoptosis by blocking EGFR in lung cancer cells A Glucosamine-Specific Lectin from Green Dragon No. 8 Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) Induced Apoptosis on Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Cells PHA-E is a natural product extracted from red kidney beans, and it has been reported to induce cell apoptosis by blocking EGFR in lung cancer cells. The anticancer activity of δ-tocotrienol, a bioactive vitamin E present in whole grain cereals, annatto beans and palm fruit, is strongly dependent on its effect on the induction of apoptosis. δ-Tocotrienol-induced apoptosis is associated with consistent induction in the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax). NDF of cooked common beans inhibited colon carcinogenesis at an early stage by inducing cell cycle arrest of colon cells and morphological changes linked to apoptosis, thus confirming previous results obtained with gene expression studies. Azuki extract also inhibited the growth of human leukemia U937 cells, leading to induction of apoptosis. Fermentation product of soybean, black bean, and green bean mixture induces apoptosis in a wide variety of cancer cells. A non-digestible fraction of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis during early carcinogenesis.	yes

481	58a5924060087bc10a000020	Can NADPH oxidase be inhibited by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium?	Ang II treatment also led to a significant increment in intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, which could be fully abolished by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium, indicating that Ang II enhanced oxidative stress via a NADPH oxidase-dependent manner. NOX inhibitors (diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or apocynin) were able to achieve similar results to that of ML-7 except no effect on MLCK activity and MLC20 phosphorylation.  Significant reductions of AII effects on podocyte TRPC6 were also observed after pretreatment with NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium (DPI).  Furthermore, inhibition of NOX-mediated ROS production with apocynin, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or NOX2 docking sequence (Nox2ds)-tat peptide during these first 4h of PE stimulation significantly inhibited PE-induced hypertrophy of H9c2 cells, both after 24 and 48h of PE stimulation.  Remarkably, Ang-II induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) via a NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent mechanism, as shown by inhibition of ROS production via the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin.  Moreover, NADPH oxidase activation by beta CD (145.5+/-9.0%; control: 98.6+/-1.6%) was also abrogated by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin (100.4+/-3.2%) and diphenylene iodonium (9.5+/-3.3%). We used structurally diverse NADPH oxidase inhibitors, aminoethyl-benzenesulfonylfluoride (AEBSF, 100-1000microM), apocynin (100-1000microM), and diphenylene iodonium (DPI, 3-30microM), to inhibit intrinsic NADPH oxidase activity in N27 cells. Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol. With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium. The contractile responses to U46619 in isolated PA were inhibited by PEG-catalase and the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin. The effects of diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, on key parameters of PSC activation were evaluated in vitro. These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAâ. Diphenylene iodonium is an inhibitor of the respiratory burst-generating NADPH oxidase of phagocytes. NADPH oxidase inhibitors [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-acetophenone)] prevented the microglial activation induced by oAâ, suggesting that NADPH oxidase activation was involved in microglial activation. In addition, inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium or apocynin) also prevented microglia proliferation, suggesting that this may be the source of hydrogen peroxide. Inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium, apocynin, D-(+)-neopterine) also significantly blunted the generation of reactive oxygen species, activation of K(+), Cl(-)-cotransport and apoptosis induced by N-ethylmaleimide. With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium. NADPH-dependent superoxide production by the solubilized oxidase of neutrophils was inhibited 36% by diphenylene iodonium at a 1:1 stoichiometry with the enzyme flavoprotein content. These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAβ Moreover, CSE-regulated COX-2, PGE(2), and IL-6 generation was inhibited by pretreatment with TLR4 Ab; inhibitors of c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride and apocynin), p38 MAPK (SB202190), MEK1/2 (U0126), JNK1/2 (SP600125), and NF-kappaB (helenalin); a ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cysteine); and transfection with siRNA of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, Src, p47(phox), p38, p42, JNK2, or p65 Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium UVB irradiation generated ROS in a dose-dependent manner, and this was significantly inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin (Apo) and neopterine (Neo), inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase, and indomethacin (Indo), a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, but not by the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors and other cytosolic enzyme inhibitors In RBA-1 cells, JEV induced MMP-9 expression and promoter activity, which was inhibited by pretreatment with inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride or apocynin), MAPKs (U0126, SB203580 or SP600125) and a ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine), or transfection with siRNAs of p47(phox) , ERK1, JNK2 and p38 Such discharge of Dectin-1-reactive β-glucan from macrophage cells was inhibited by either NADPH oxidase inhibitors (apocynin and diphenylene iodonium) or radical scavengers (N-acetyl cysteine and MCI-186) The contractile responses to U46619 in isolated PA were inhibited by PEG-catalase and the NADPH oxidase inhibitors diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin ANG II further increased superoxide production in LP only, and this was inhibited by coincubation with diphenylene iodonium or apocynin (inhibitor of NADPH oxidase complex) Our results showed that IL-1beta enhanced HTSMCs-monocyte adhesion through up-regulation of VCAM-1, which was inhibited by pretreatment with selective inhibitors of PKCalpha (Gö6976), c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (APO)], intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA/AM), PI-PLC (U73122), CaM (calmidazolium chloride), CaM kinase II (KN62), p300 (garcinol), NF-kappaB (Bay11-7082), HDAC (trichostatin A), and ROS scavenger [N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)] or transfection with siRNAs of MyD88, PKCalpha, Src, p47(phox), p300, and HDAC4. Here we show that cAMP-dependent decidualization can be attenuated or enhanced upon treatment of primary cultures with a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor (diphenylen iodonium) or activator (apocynin), respectively.  With the use of dihydroethidium as a superoxide indicator, C(2)-ceramide was found to increase superoxide production in the endothelial cells of small coronary arteries, which was inhibited by the NADPH oxidase inhibitors N-vanillylnonanamide, apocynin, and diphenylene iodonium.  The inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase by apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, and of the mitochondrial electron transport system at complex II by thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), significantly inhibited both AGE-induced ROS production and VCAM-1 expression, whereas these effects were potentiated by rotenone and antimycin A, specific inhibitors of mitochondrial complex I and III, respectively.  Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol.  Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects.  The G6PD inhibitor DHEA and the inhibitors of NADPH oxidase apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI) prevented both superoxide generation and capacitation in human spermatozoa, but whereas DPI and DHEA inhibited PPP, apocynin did not influence it, suggesting that PPP activation during capacitation is not a response to increased oxidative stress but exerts a role by supplying reducing equivalents to oxygen. Ang II induced a time-dependent increase in Rac1 activation and O(2)(*-) production in Neuro-2A cells, and this was abolished by pretreatment with AdN17Rac1 or the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium.  Paraquat-induced ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium (DPI), but not the xanthine/xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol. In RBA-1 cells, JEV induced MMP-9 expression and promoter activity, which was inhibited by pretreatment with inhibitors of NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride or apocynin), MAPKs (U0126, SB203580 or SP600125) and a ROS scavenger (N-acetylcysteine), or transfection with siRNAs of p47(phox) , ERK1, JNK2 and p38. These effects could be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, indicating a self-cycle regulated by NADPH oxidase in microglial activation in response to oAβ. Treatment of the cells with the NADPH oxidase inhibitors, apocynin and diphenylene iodonium, inhibited these effects. UVB irradiation generated ROS in a dose-dependent manner, and this was significantly inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin (Apo) and neopterine (Neo), inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase, and indomethacin (Indo), a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, but not by the mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors and other cytosolic enzyme inhibitors. Such discharge of Dectin-1-reactive β-glucan from macrophage cells was inhibited by either NADPH oxidase inhibitors (apocynin and diphenylene iodonium) or radical scavengers (N-acetyl cysteine and MCI-186). Our results showed that IL-1beta enhanced HTSMCs-monocyte adhesion through up-regulation of VCAM-1, which was inhibited by pretreatment with selective inhibitors of PKCalpha (Gö6976), c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (APO)], intracellular calcium chelator (BAPTA/AM), PI-PLC (U73122), CaM (calmidazolium chloride), CaM kinase II (KN62), p300 (garcinol), NF-kappaB (Bay11-7082), HDAC (trichostatin A), and ROS scavenger [N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC)] or transfection w Moreover, CSE-regulated COX-2, PGE(2), and IL-6 generation was inhibited by pretreatment with TLR4 Ab; inhibitors of c-Src (PP1), NADPH oxidase (diphenylene iodonium chloride and apocynin), p38 MAPK (SB202190), MEK1/2 (U0126), JNK1/2 (SP600125), and NF-kappaB (helenalin); a ROS scavenger (N-acetyl-l-cysteine); and transfection with siRNA of TLR4, MyD88, TRAF6, Src, p47(phox), p38, p42, JNK2, or p65. The use of diphenylene iodonium, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, to investigate the antimicrobial action of human monocyte derived macrophages. NADPH oxidase inhibitors [diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and apocynin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-acetophenone)] prevented the microglial activation induced by oAβ, suggesting that NADPH oxidase activation was involved in microglial activation. Furthermore, inhibition of NOX-mediated ROS production with apocynin, diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or NOX2 docking sequence (Nox2ds)-tat peptide during these first 4h of PE stimulation significantly inhibited PE-induced hypertrophy of H9c2 cells, both after 24 and 48h of PE stimulation. We compared the pharmacological profiles of the commonly used NADPH oxidase inhibitors, diphenylene iodonium (DPI), apocynin and 4-(2-amino-ethyl)-benzolsulphonyl-fluoride (AEBSF), as well as the novel triazolo pyrimidine VAS3947. IL-1beta and TNF-alpha rapidly stimulated the rate of hydrogen peroxide produced by isolated microglia, and this was inhibited by diphenylene iodonium, implying that the cytokines were acting directly on microglia to stimulate the NADPH oxidase. The fractions achieved the same effects that known NADPH oxidase inhibitors, such as diphenylene iodonium and apocynin, but they presented better hydrosolubility. Ang II induced a time-dependent increase in Rac1 activation and O(2)(*-) production in Neuro-2A cells, and this was abolished by pretreatment with AdN17Rac1 or the NADPH oxidase inhibitors apocynin or diphenylene iodonium.	yes
483	589c334e78275d0c4a00003d	Is NSD-1015 an inhibitor of Aromatic L-Amino Acid Decarboxylase?	When pretreated with a central AADC inhibitor (NSD-1015), further application of l-dopa failed to increase the motoneuron activity although the expression of DA in the AADC cells was not completely inhibited.  Inhibition of Ddc by AADC inhibitor NSD-1015 or anti-sense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) reduced brain volume and body length.  We evaluated this in vivo by reverse dialysis of the aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28) inhibitor NSD-1015 (20μM) and selected concentrations of l- or d-tyrosine.  Neurochemical study of effects of the new anxiolytic drugs afobazol and ladasten on the synthesis and metabolism of monoamines and their metabolites in the brain structures of Wistar rat on the model of monoamine synthesis blockade induced by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015 To establish the neurotransmitter role(s) of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in its own right, we attempted to clarify whether i.p. injection of a DOPA antagonist, DOPA cyclohexyl ester (CHE), would antagonize the behavioral responses of conscious rats to DOPA in the presence of 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015) (100 mg/kg i.p.), a central aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor. TH and TPH activities were determined in tissue extracts by measuring the accumulation of L-Dopa and 5-HTP respectively, following the administration of the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015.  Results of a neurochemical study of the effects of the new anxiolytic drugs afobazole and ladasten on the synthesis and metabolism of monoamines and their metabolites determined by HPLC on the model of monoamine synthesis blockade induced by NSD-1015 (aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase) in the brain structures of Wistar rats are reported.  . When pretreated with a central AADC inhibitor (NSD-1015) NSD 1015 (general AADC inhibitor) monoamine synthesis blockade induced by NSD-1015 (aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase)  the aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.28) inhibitor NSD-1015 An accumulation of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in the median eminence of female rats treated with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), and inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (DOPA decarboxylase) activity, was associated with a decreased concentration of dopamine in the median eminence and pronounced reduction in the release of dopamine into hypophysial portal blood. 6S-BH4 increased extracellular DOPA levels in the presence of NSD 1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (an index of in vivo tyrosine hydroxylase activity), to an extent similar to the increase induced by 6R-BH4. 5-HT synthesis was estimated by measuring the accumulation of the 5-HT precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), in the neurointermediate lobe of male Long-Evans rats following the administration of NSD 1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase. Monoamine synthesis was studied in different parts of the brain by measuring the accumulated dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), 30 min after NSD 1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine HCl, 100 mg/kg) an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino-acid decarboxylase, given i.p. HPLC coupled with electrochemical detection was used to make concurrent measurements of the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine in selected brain regions (striatum, nucleus accumbens, septum, medial periventricular hypothalamus) and thoracic spinal cords of rats treated with NSD 1015, an inhibitor of aromatic-L-amino-acid decarboxylase. The activity of 5-hydroxytryptaminergic neurons has been estimated from measurements of: concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid; the ratio of the concentrations of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid to 5-hydroxytryptamine; the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan following the administration of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., NSD 1015); the rate of accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine, and the rate of decline of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid following the administration of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (e.g., pargyline). The accumulation of dopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) after administration of NSD 1015 to inhibit aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase was determined as an index of NE synthesis. The central aromatic amino acid DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, does not inhibit L-DOPA-induced circling in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned-rats. The centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine (NSD-1015), is widely used to study the neurotransmitter-like actions of L-DOPA. The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, increases release of dopamine: response characteristics. The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD 1015 markedly increased the dopa concentration. Using a microdialysis technique, the rat striatum was perfused with NSD-1015, an inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, and the amount of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) accumulating in dialysate was measured as an index of in vivo activities of tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase. Also, we studied the effect of MnCl2 on extracellular levels of l-Dopa in the presence of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor 3-hydroxybencilhydracine-HCl (NSD 1015). The role of L-DOPA itself was investigated by administering several doses of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, prior to 100 mg/kg L-DOPA to 5-day-old rats. An accumulation of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in the median eminence of female rats treated with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), and inhibitor of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (DOPA decarboxylase) activity, was associated with a decreased concentration of dopamine in the median eminence and pronounced reduction in the release of dopamine into hypophysial portal blood.  [Neurochemical study of effects of the new anxiolytic drugs afobazol and ladasten on the synthesis and metabolism of monoamines and their metabolites in the brain structures of Wistar rat on the model of monoamine synthesis blockade induced by aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015]. DOPA was measured in the anterior pituitary and hypothalamic-hypophysial portal blood after treatment with NSD-1015, a DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor.  Central action of an inhibitor of brain dopa-decarboxylase, NSD-1015, on cyanamide-induced alcohol drinking in rats. The role of L-DOPA itself was investigated by administering several doses of an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, prior to 100 mg/kg L-DOPA to 5-day-old rats.  The centrally acting aromatic amino acid dopa decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzyl hydrazine (NSD-1015), is widely used to study the neurotransmitter-like actions of L-DOPA.  Furthermore, the ethanol-induced enhancement of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine accumulation in the mesolimbic dopamine terminal area after NSD 1015 (an inhibitor of l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase) was completely antagonized by mecamylamine in doses (3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg) that exerted no effects per se. The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) enhanced L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels in both the corpus striatum and limbic areas (nucleus accumbens) after inhibition of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase with NSD-1015, indicating an enhanced synthesis of dopamine in these brain regions. Estradiol benzoate-treated rats had significantly lower anterior pituitary DOPA accumulation after intraperitoneal administration of 3,4-hydroxybenzyl-hydrazine dihydrochloride (NSD-1015), an irreversible inhibitor of L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase whereas methylene blue did not affect anterior pituitary DOPA accumulation when compared to controls. The accumulation of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) following administration of the L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, was used to estimate DA synthesis. Inhibition of PE synthesis by i.p. injection of the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD 1015, produced a reversal of the effects of MDL 72,145 and Ro 19-6327. After 42 hr of abstinence, rats were challenged with either cocaine (15 mg/kg, ip) or saline, followed by the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015; 100 mg/kg, ip). Following motor activity observations, the cerebral aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor NSD-1015 (100 mg kg-1 intraperitoneally) was administered and 30 min. later the animals were decapitated for subsequent analysis of the accumulated forebrain DOPA and 5-HTP levels, as an estimate of the rate of monoamine synthesis. The utility of this technique was demonstrated by comparing the effects on the scans of halothane and pentobarbital anesthesia and by the administration of NSD 1015, a peripheral and central inhibitor of L-aromatic amino-acid decarboxylase, between back-to-back scans. Addition of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015), prevented the formation of N-acetylcompounds from L-[3H]tyrosine, without resulting in an accumulation of label in L-DOPA. The effects of the peripheral aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) inhibitors, carbidopa and benserazide, and the central AADC inhibitor, 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015) on peripheral and brain monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B activity were investigated in the rat. Although the putative role of NSD-1015 is as an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, the present results demonstrate that, either as a result of this function and/or in addition to this role, NSD-1015 is a potent activator of the release of dopamine. The aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, increases release of dopamine: response characteristics. The central aromatic amino acid DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015, does not inhibit L-DOPA-induced circling in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned-rats. The L-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, NSD-1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine dihydrochloride) was then given ICV twice daily in a volume of 5.0 microliters in the following doses: 0.005, 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 micrograms. Although the putative role of NSD-1015 is as an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, the present results demonstrate that, either as a result of this function and/or in addition to this role, NSD-1015 is a potent activator of the release of dopamine..	yes
510	58c0836102b8c6095300001c	Is there a relationship between B cells and Multiple Sclerosis?	These results suggest that RRMS patients with radiological phenotypes showing high neurodegeneration have changes in B cells characterized by down-regulation of B-cell-specific genes and increased activation status Although the exact etiology is still obscure, the leading hypothesis behind MS relapses is acute inflammatory attacks on CNS myelin and axons. This complex process involves B and T cells together with macrophages and microglia. It is currently known that CD24 serves as a costimulatory factor of T cells that regulate their homeostasis and proliferation, while in B cells, CD24 is functionally involved in cell activation and differentiation. CD24 can enhance autoimmune diseases in terms of its protective role in the clonal deletion of autoreactive thymocytes Multiple B cell-dependent mechanisms contributing to inflammatory demyelination of the CNS have been explored using experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a CD4 T cell-dependent animal model for multiple sclerosis.  The role of B cells in multiple sclerosis: rationale for B-cell-targeted therapies. Interest in CD8+ T cells and B cells was initially inspired by observations in multiple sclerosis rather than in animal models: CD8+ T cells predominate in multiple sclerosis lesions, oligoclonal immunoglobulin bands in CSF have long been recognised as diagnostic and prognostic markers, and anti-B-cell therapies showed considerable efficacy in multiple sclerosis. Differential effects of fingolimod on B-cell populations in multiple sclerosis. Unaltered regulatory B-cell frequency and function in patients with multiple sclerosis. B cells are increasingly recognized as major players in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis. These observations underscore the B cell's contribution to the putative underpinnings of multiple sclerosis. Data suggesting that B cells play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis have been accumulating for the past five decades, demonstrating that the cerebrospinal fluid and central nervous system tissues of multiple sclerosis patients contain B cells, plasma cells, antibodies, and immunoglobulins. B-cell-targeted treatment for multiple sclerosis: mechanism of action and clinical data. Subset composition and cytokine production of B cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from multiple sclerosis patients under Fingolimod treatment, untreated multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls were analyzed by flow cytometry and ELISA. In particular, antigen presentation between B cells and T cells, increased trafficking of B cells across the blood-brain barrier, and autoantibodies produced by plasma cells may contribute to the pathophysiology of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Accumulating evidence supports a major role of B cells in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis. Further research is needed to elucidate the pathology of B cells and their role in central nervous system autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis.

548	58db94948acda34529000017	Does the Abelson-related gene (ARG) gene encode for a serine kinase?	One isoform of Arg/Abl2 tyrosine kinase is nuclear and the other seven cytosolic isoforms differently modulate cell morphology, motility and the cytoskeleton. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson related gene (Arg/Abl2) regulates cell migration and morphogenesis by modulating the cytoskeleton.  The human Arg (Abl2) nonreceptor tyrosine kinase has a role in cytoskeletal rearrangements by its C-terminal F-actin- and microtubule-binding sequences.  The tyrosine kinase abl-related gene ARG is fused to ETV6 in an AML-M4Eo patient with a t(1;12)(q25;p13): molecular cloning of both reciprocal transcripts.  The ARG gene encodes for a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase characterized by high homology with c-Abl in the TK, SH2, and SH3 domains. This is the first report on ARG involvement in a human malignancy. Ultraviolet-A and -B differentially modify the tyrosine-kinase profile of human keratinocytes and induce the expression of Arg+. Arg (Abelson-related gene, Abl2) was the PTK with the highest prevalence (30% of all PTKs) and UVA led to a further induction of Arg expression reaching nine-fold mRNA baseline expression at 17 h after irradiation. To investigate the expression profile of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) in response to UVA and UVB we employed a reversed transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach using degenerate primers derived from the conserved catalytic domain of PTKs.  By 3'rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (3'RACE-PCR), a novel fusion transcript was identified between the ETV6 and the Abelson-related gene (ARG) at 1q25, resulting in a chimeric protein consisting of the HLH oligomerization domain of ETV6 and the SH2, SH3, and protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) domains of ARG. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson related gene (Arg/Abl2) regulates cell migration and morphogenesis by modulating the cytoskeleton. Arg (Abelson-related gene, Abl2) was the PTK with the highest prevalence (30% of all PTKs) and UVA led to a further induction of Arg expression reaching nine-fold mRNA baseline expression at 17 h after irradiation. We studied the relationship of direct karyotypes, determined at diagnosis and remission, to Abelson-related tyrosine kinase activity and the cytogenetic features of erythroid and myeloid colonies derived from remission marrow of six children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). ABL2/ARG (ABL-related gene) belongs to the ABL (Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase) family of tyrosine kinases The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abelson related gene (Arg/Abl2) regulates cell migration and morphogenesis by modulating the cytoskeleton The ARG gene encodes for a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase characterized by high homology with c-Abl in the TK, SH2, and SH3 domains. ABL2/ARG (ABL-related gene) belongs to the ABL (Abelson tyrosine-protein kinase) family of tyrosine kinases. We report that the Abelson (Abl) and Abl-related gene (Arg) nonreceptor tyrosine kinases are required for maintenance of cortical dendrites in the mouse brain. The products of the human ARG gene and the human ABL gene characterize the Abelson family of non-receptor tyrosine protein kinases. The products of the human Arg gene and human, mouse, Drosophila, and nematode Abl genes characterize the Abelson family of nonreceptor tyrosine protein kinase.

552	58f0b40d70f9fc6f0f000008	Are selenium supplements recommended for prostate cancer prevention?	Our meta-analysis in prospective studies demonstrated a significant inverse association between selenium status and CVD risk within a narrow selenium range and a null effect of selenium supplementation on CVD was observed in RCTs. These findings indicate the importance of considering selenium status, dose and safety in health assessment and future study design. Selenium supplementation of 140 or more μg/day after diagnosis of nonmetastatic prostate cancer may increase risk of prostate cancer mortality. Caution is warranted regarding usage of such supplements among men with prostate cancer. The SELECT study failed to show any significant risk reduction for prostate cancers ascribable to selenium and vitamin E supplementations. Vitamins and supplements, including selenium or vitamin E, have not been proven in clinical trials to prevent prostate cancer and in the case of Vitamin E has been found to increase the risk of incident prostate cancer. Ongoing and future trials may further elucidate the role of diet and immunotherapy for prevention of prostate cancer.	no

Anesthesia-resistant memory (ARM) was described decades ago, but the mechanisms that underlie this protein synthesis-independent form of consolidated memory inDrosophilaremain poorly understood. Whether the several signaling molecules, receptors, and synaptic proteins currently implicated in ARM operate in one or more pathways and how they function in the process remain unclear.

578	59bf823b542ba3824b000001	Does a tonsillectomy affect the patient's voice?	 Group B had a better awareness of tooth damage (78% vs 30% of patients, P ≤ .001), voice change (61 vs 19%, P = .005), and burns to lips and mouth (44% vs 8%, P = .005). Finally, 35% more patients from group B rated their understanding of tonsillectomy as good or very good (P = .017).  Some patients complaint for dry throat, foreign body sensation or voice change after tonsillectomy. The percentage of patients who had temporary voice change was 62.7%, and 15.4% had a follow-up clinic visit. There is no dose-escalation response to dexamethasone (0.0625-1.0 mg/kg) in pediatric tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy patients for preventing vomiting, reducing pain, shortening time to first liquid intake, or the incidence of voice change. There were no differences in secondary outcomes (analgesic requirements, time to first liquid, and change in voice) across treatment groups. Voice change, reported by approximately 70% of all patients, was the most common complaint, but it resolved in all instances. The incidence rates of voice change, velopharyngeal insufficiency, bleeding, constipation, dehydration, and pain were measured.  Tonsillectomy affects voice performance negatively in adults in short term; however, it does not affect voice performance in long term after surgery. The surgical technique, whether it is cold knife or thermal welding system, does not appear to affect voice and speech in tonsillectomy patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in acoustic features of voice after tonsillectomy. Surgical indications for tonsillectomy in the young voice patient are discussed. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to assess patient perception and acoustic characteristics of voice before and after upper airway surgery. In this report, we examined the change in pharyngeal size and acoustic feature of voice after tonsillectomy.

587	5a76056983b0d9ea66000012	Does DDX54 play a role in DNA damage response?	DDX54 regulates transcriptome dynamics during DNA damage response. The contribution of post-transcriptional gene regulatory networks to the DNA damage response (DDR) has not been extensively studied. Here, we systematically identified RNA-binding proteins differentially interacting with polyadenylated transcripts upon exposure of human breast carcinoma cells to ionizing radiation (IR). Interestingly, more than 260 proteins, including many nucleolar proteins, showed increased binding to poly(A)+RNA in IR-exposed cells. The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs. Upon IR exposure, DDX54 acts by increased interaction with a well-defined class of pre-mRNAs that harbor introns with weak acceptor splice sites, as well as by protein-protein contacts within components of U2 snRNP and spliceosomal B complex, resulting in lower intron retention and higher processing rates of its target transcripts. Because DDX54 promotes survival after exposure to IR, its expression and/or mutation rate may impact DDR-related pathologies. Our work indicates the relevance of many uncharacterized RBPs potentially involved in the DDR. The functional analysis of DDX54, a candidate genotoxic stress responsive RNA helicase, revealed that this protein is an immediate-to-early DDR regulator required for the splicing efficacy of its target IR-induced pre-mRNAs.	yes

disease ibd they are characterized by chronic relapsing inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract significantly impacting on patient quality of life and often requiring prolonged treatment existing therapies for ibd are not effective for all patients and an unmet need exists for additional therapies to induce and maintain remission here we describe the mechanism of action of the janus kinase jak inhibitor tofacitinib for the treatment of ibd and the effect of jak inhibition on the chronic cycle of inflammation that is characteristic of the disease the pathogenesis of ibd involves a dysfunctional response from the innate and adaptive immune system resulting in overexpression of multiple inflammatory cytokines many of which signal through jaks thus jak inhibition allows multiple cytokine signaling pathways to be targeted and is expected to modulate the innate and adaptive immune response in ibd thereby interrupting the cycle of inflammation tofacitinib is an oral small molecule jak inhibitor that is being investigated as a targeted immunomodulator for ibd clinical development of tofacitinib and other jak inhibitors is ongoing with the aspiration of providing new treatment options for ibd that have the potential to deliver prolonged efficacy and clinically meaningful patient benefits.	yes
606	5a76080683b0d9ea66000015	Is cilengitide effective for treatment of glioblastoma?	RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056). However, we could not conclusively confirm whether cilengitide 2000mg/5/week was the optimum regime, as only one trial using this protocol was included in our study. Cilengitide (CGT) is a cyclic pentapeptide that demonstrated efficacy for GBM treatment by targeting the integrins avβ3 and avβ5 over-expressed on GBM cells. Cilengitide is recently failed in Phase III CENTRIC trial in unselected patients with GBM. In conclusion, we demonstrate that EGFRvIII/integrin β3 complexes promote GBM progression and metastasis in the environment of hypoxia and vitronectin-enrichment, and cilengitide may serve as a promising therapeutics for EGFRvIII-positive GBMs. he addition of molecularly targeted drugs to TEM + RAD did not improve the OS of patients with GBM; however, it did improve PFS in patients treated by cilengitide who could not get improvement in OS.   The randomized phase III CENTRIC and phase II CORE trials explored the integrin inhibitor cilengitide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with versus without O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. These trials failed to meet their primary endpoints . In CORE, higher αvβ3 levels in tumor cells were associated with improved progression-free survival by central review and with improved overall survival in patients treated with cilengitide. Cilengitide combined with metronomic temozolomide and procarbazine in MGMT-promoter unmethylated glioblastoma did not improve survival compared with historical data and does not warrant further investigation. The addition of cilengitide to temozolomide chemoradiotherapy did not improve outcomes; cilengitide will not be further developed as an anticancer drug. Cilengitide treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients does not alter patterns of progression. It may be proposed that the combination therapy of NG2 suppression and cilengitide treatment showed no considerable effect on glioblastoma compared to cilengitide therapy alone.	no

Using an in vivo biotinylation tagging approach in mice, we show that the nucleotide excision repair (NER) structure-specific endonuclease ERCC1-XPF complex interacts with the insulator binding protein CTCF, the cohesin subunits SMC1A and SMC3 and with MBD2; the factors co-localize with ATRX at the promoters and control regions (ICRs) of imprinted genes during postnatal hepatic development.

616	5a68eabab750ff4455000015	Is there an association between Klinefelter syndrome and breast cancer?	Screening for breast cancer in male-to-female transsexuals should be undertaken for those with additional risk factors (e.g., family history, BRCA2 mutation, Klinefelter syndrome) and should be available to those who desire screening, preferably in a clinical trial. Klinefelter syndrome (OR = 24.7; 95% CI = 8.94 to 68.4) and gynecomastia (OR = 9.78; 95% CI = 7.52 to 12.7) were also statistically significantly associated with risk, relations that were independent of BMI.  Male breast cancer risk factors show strong association with BRCA2 mutations, as well as Klinefelter syndrome.  The main risk factors include: the mutation of genes BRCA 1 and 2, Klinefelter's syndrome, alcohol, liver disease, obesity.  Although aetiology is still unclear, constitutional, environmental, hormonal (abnormalities in estrogen/androgen balance) and genetic (positive family history, Klinefelter syndrome, mutations in BRCA1 and specially BRCA2) risk factors are already known.  The largest study found 19.2- and 57.8-fold increases in incidence and mortality, respectively, with particularly high risks among 47,XXY mosaics.  CONCLUSIONS: Additional well-designed epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify which patients with KS are at a high risk of developing MBC and to distinguish between possible predisposing factors, including altered endogenous hormones. Major risk factors for developing male BC include clinical disorders involving hormonal imbalances (excess of estrogen or a deficiency of testosterone as seen in patients with Klinefelter syndrome) and a positive family history for breast cancer.  Patients with 47, XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer, germ cell tumours and non Hodgkin lymphomas, but rarely acute myeloid leukaemia.  Breast cancer in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome is reported. The increased conversion of testosterone to estradiol at the therapy with androgens might be responsible for the development of breast cancer in Klinefelter's syndrome. Patients with a 47,XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have an increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer and germ cell tumors, but rarely malignant hematologic disorders. The frequencies of diabetes mellitus, breast cancer, and germ cell neoplasia increases in Klinefelter's syndrome. There is evidence, however, to suggest that Klinefelter's males have an increased risk of breast cancer that approaches three percent. Klinefelter syndrome has been consistently associated with breast cancer in men (MBC).<br><b>CASE REPORT</b>: We report a 54-year old man was diagnosed as synchronous bilateral breast cancer with Klinefelter syndrome. These results support a hormonal etiology for breast cancer in men and for prostate cancer and suggest that men with Klinefelter syndrome may be at substantially elevated risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and, perhaps, lung cancer. Major genetic factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer for men include BRCA2 mutations, which are believed to account for the majority of inherited breast cancer in men, Klinefelter syndrome, and a positive family history. Those affected by Klinefelter's syndrome are at increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus, breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS These results support a hormonal etiology for breast cancer in men and for prostate cancer and suggest that men with Klinefelter syndrome may be at substantially elevated risks for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and, perhaps, lung cancer. Compared with the general population, men with Klinefelter syndrome had higher mortality from lung cancer (SMR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0 to 2.0), breast cancer (SMR = 57.8, 95% CI = 18.8 to 135.0), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (SMR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.6 to 6.6) and lower mortality from prostate cancer (SMR = 0, 95% CI = 0 to 0.7). Klinefelter syndrome has been consistently associated with breast cancer in men (MBC). Male breast cancer risk factors show strong association with BRCA2 mutations, as well as Klinefelter syndrome. Patients with 47, XXY karyotype (Klinefelter syndrome) appear to have increased risk of developing cancer, especially male breast cancer, germ cell tumours and non Hodgkin lymphomas, but rarely acute myeloid leukaemia. Klinefelter syndrome, in which patients carry XXY chromosome, may be present in men with breast cancer for this reason they often develop gynecomastia.<br> Klinefelter syndrome has been consistently associated with breast cancer in men (MBC).

627	5a8714e261bb38fb24000005	Is polyadenylation a process that stabilizes a protein by adding a string of Adenosine residues to the end of the molecule?	The addition of poly(A) tails to eukaryotic nuclear mRNAs promotes their stability, export to the cytoplasm and translation.  Most eukaryotic genes express mRNAs with alternative polyadenylation sites at their 3' ends Polyadenylation is the non-template addition of adenosine nucleotides at the 3'-end of RNA, which occurs after transcription and generates a poly(A) tail up to 250-300 nucleotides long. Polyadenylation is a process of endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA, followed by addition of up to 250 adenosine residues to the 3' end of the mRNA. Plant mitochondrial polyadenylated mRNAs are degraded by a 3'- to 5'-exoribonuclease activity, which proceeds unimpeded by stable secondary structures. We show that a 3'- to 5'-exoribonuclease activity is responsible for the preferential degradation of polyadenylated mRNAs as compared with non-polyadenylated mRNAs, and that 20-30 adenosine residues constitute the optimal poly(A) tail size for inducing degradation of RNA substrates in vitro. The diversity of polyadenylation sites suggests that mRNA polyadenylation in prokaryotes is a relatively indiscriminate process that can occur at all mRNA's 3'-ends and does not require specific consensus sequences as in eukaryotes. Polyadenylation of premessenger RNAs occurs posttranscriptionally in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells by cleavage of the precursor and polymerization of adenosine residues. However, under certain conditions, poly(A) tracts may lead to mRNA stabilization. From these results, we propose that in plant mitochondria, poly(A) tails added at the 3' ends of mRNAs promote an efficient 3'- to 5'- degradation process.. Auxiliary downstream elements are required for efficient polyadenylation of mammalian pre-mRNAs. Transcription in these cells is polycistronic. Tens to hundreds of protein-coding genes of unrelated function are arrayed in long clusters on the same DNA strand. Polycistrons are cotranscriptionally processed by trans-splicing at the 5' end and polyadenylation at the 3' end, generating monocistronic units ready for degradation or translation We have devised a simple chromatographic procedure which isolates five polyadenylation factors that are required for polyadenylation of eukaryotic mRNA.  During mammalian oocyte maturation, protein synthesis is mainly controlled through cytoplasmic polyadenylation of stored maternal mRNAs. Identification and characterization of a polyadenylated small RNA (s-poly A+ RNA) in dinoflagellates. Thus, polyadenylation seems to be a major component of the RNA editing machinery that affects overlapping genes in animal mitochondria. Pre-mRNA 3'-end processing, the process through which almost all eukaryotic mRNAs acquire a poly(A) tail is generally inhibited during the cellular DNA damage Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs possess 3' ends with a polyadenylate (poly(A)) tail. We previously demonstrated, by limited mutagenesis, that conserved sequence elements within the 5' end of influenza virus virion RNA (vRNA) are required for the polyadenylation of mRNA in vitro. Polyadenylation of mRNA precursors by poly(A) polymerase depends on two specificity factors and their recognition sequences The majority of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs are processed by 3'-end cleavage and polyadenylation Formation of mRNA 3' termini involves cleavage of an mRNA precursor and polyadenylation of the newly formed end.  The polyadenylation of RNA is a near-universal feature of RNA metabolism in eukaryotes. The mechanism of RNA degradation in Escherichia coli involves endonucleolytic cleavage, polyadenylation of the cleavage product by poly(A) polymerase, and exonucleolytic degradation by the exoribonucleases,  The addition of poly(A)-tails to RNA is a process common to almost all organisms.  The addition of poly(A) tails to RNA is a phenomenon common to all organisms examined so far.  The addition of poly(A)-tails to RNA is a phenomenon common to almost all organisms.

8	51680a49298dcd4e51000062	Is it possible to detect survivin protein expression in normal human adult tissues?	Survivin (BIRC5) is one of the members of IAP-family apoptosis inhibitors. The BIRCS gene is expressed in most human embryonic tissues and malignant tumors but not in normal differentiated tissues of adult human. Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis that is undetectable in most terminally differentiated normal human tissues, strongly expressed in embryonic and fetal organs and is strongly expressed in many different human cancers. Survivin is a member of the inhibitor apoptosis family that is overexpressed in many malignancies. It has five known alternative splice forms, some of which differ in their antiapoptotic properties and expression levels in human cancers. survivin is usually not expressed in normal adult tissues, AZD1152-hQPA induced caspase-dependent apoptosis of some cell lines, demonstrated by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase-9, followed by activation of caspase-3. This effect was accompanied by the inhibition of survivin expression. In vivo efficacy was determined in NOD/SCID/γc(null) mice implanted with the Ramos human BL cell line. AZD1152 had anti-tumour effects in this murine xenograft model. There preclinical data suggest that the inhibition of Aurora B kinase is a potentially useful therapeutic strategy in BL and HL. a novel antiapoptosis gene, i.e., survivin, was identified as a structurally unique member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family. Survivin expression is turned off during fetal development and not found in non-neoplastic adult human tissues but is again turned on in the most common human cancers. The antiapoptotic properties of survivin might provide a significant growth advantage in tumors and possibly also contribute to chemoresistance of cancer. Further comparison of the distribution of PDEF with other widely recognized cancer-associated molecules showed that PDEF has more restricted distributions than Her-2/neu, Bcl-2, survivin or telomerase in cDNA libraries from normal human tissues and more increased distribution than Her-2/neu, CA-125, Bcl-2, survivin and telomerase in cDNA libraries from brain (except survivin), breast, lung and ovarian tumors. These data together show a better tumor-association for PDEF and suggest that PDEF is a more suitable target for developing specific cancer therapies. we identified decreased FHIT expression resulting in apoptosis inhibition and decreasing apoptosis associated with abnormal levels of some pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bcl-2 and Survivin) by TUNEL and TMA. Our results demonstrated that the mutation in the FHIT gene significantly reduced FHIT expression in human CRC. Both TUNEL and TMA experiments demonstrated significantly inhibited apoptosis by down-regulation of Bax and up-regulation of Survivin and Bcl-2. Collectively, these studies identify the mechanism by which an important tumor suppressor gene, FHIT, inactivated specifically in human CRC, and contributes to our understanding of the mechanism of colorectal carcinogenesis.	no

28	515df89e298dcd4e5100002f	Can clonidine be used to reduce agitation in children.	Children receiving clonidine immediately after anesthesia induction had statistically significant improvement in postoperative agitation at the 15-minute mark (P = .096) and last score obtained (P = .095) using the Watcha scale. Clonidine has proven to be effective in reducing the incidence of post-operative agitation at a higher dose (3 and 2 μg kg⁻¹). Post-anaesthetic agitation was observed in two patients (6.6%) in group 1, eight patients (26.6%) in group 2 as compared to 12 patients (40%) in group 3 after 15 min of post-operative observation. The mean scores in group 1 at 15 and 30 min were significantly lower than those in group 3 (P value <0.05) Caudal clonidine at a lower dose (1 μg kg⁻¹) could be effective in reducing the incidence of sevoflurane-induced emergence agitation in children undergoing urogenital and lower limb surgery without any significant adverse effects. Only the 4 microg kg-1 dose of clonidine was associated with a significant reduction in emergence agitation. Fewer children in the clonidine 4 microg kg-1 group displayed agitation (25%) than in the midazolam group (60%) (P=0.025). In comparison with midazolam, clonidine 4 microg kg-1 reduced sevoflurane-induced emergence agitation without increasing postoperative side-effects. Prophylactic use of clonidine against sevoflurane-induced agitation may represent a new and promising application. One hundred and twenty children were included in this study: 59 of whom received clonidine, and 61 placebo; 41% of those in the placebo group exhibited moderate-severe EA compared with only 22% of those in the clonidine group (P < 0.03). Findings demonstrate that i.v. clonidine administered after induction of anesthesia significantly reduces the incidence of EA in young children, but is associated with sleepiness postoperatively. Clonidine could not prevent agitation (incidence 54%, 13/24) Clonidine 1.5 microg/kg did not differ from placebo with respect to postoperative agitation. Clonidine is effective in treating sevoflurane-induced postanesthesia agitation in children. Pain and discomfort scores were significantly decreased in the clonidine group; the incidence of agitation was reduced by 57% (P = 0.029) and the incidence of severe agitation by 67% (P = 0.064). Relative risks for developing agitation and severe agitation were 0.43 (95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.78) and 0.32 (0.09-1.17), respectively. Clonidine produces a substantial reduction in the risk of postsevoflurane agitation in children. Agitation was observed in 12 midazolam-treated and five clonidine-treated patients (P=0.05). Compared with midazolam, clonidine premedication reduced agitation during sevoflurane induction. Clonidine 3 micrograms kg-1 prevented agitation after sevoflurane anaesthesia, independently of the route of administration. The effect of clonidine appears to be dose-dependent, as an epidural dose of 1 microgram kg-1 failed to reduce it. Clonidine prevents sevoflurane-induced agitation in children. In 16 placebo and 2 clonidine-treated patients agitation was observed (P < 0.001) In 6 patients of the Placebo group, agitation was graded as severe, whereas none of the patients in the Clonidine group developed severe agitation (P = 0.02). We conclude that clonidine effectively prevents agitation after sevoflurane anesthesia. Clonidine 2 microg/kg IV after anesthetic induction effectively reduces the incidence of agitation without resulting in clinically relevant bradycardia and hypotension. Children receiving clonidine prior to undergoing strabismus surgery have a small but noticeable reduction in postoperative agitation, stay slightly longer in the post-anesthesia care unit, and have higher rates of parent satisfaction. We report three cases of preoperative use of intranasal clonidine in pediatric patients, all for different indications. One patient was treated for preoperative agitation and hallucinations associated with oral midazolam. One patient was given clonidine as a premedicant. The third patient was treated for preoperative agitation and hypertension. All three patients had subjective resolution of indicated symptoms and none experienced adverse outcomes. Oral or intravenous clonidine has been successfully used for the prevention of sevoflurane-induced agitation during emergence from anaesthesia.	yes

Participants included 132 children with ASD and 81 with special educational needs (SEN) but no ASD, aged 10-14 years plus 82 typically developing (TD) children The ASD group had significantly increased past vomiting and diarrhoea compared with the TD group and more abdominal pain than the SEN group Many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) suffer from gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal pain Children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) experience high rates of anxiety, sensory processing problems, and gastrointestinal (GI) problems The results indicate that anxiety, sensory over-responsivity and GI problems are possibly interrelated phenomenon for children with ASD, and may have common underlying mechanisms. Lactase deficiency not associated with intestinal inflammation or injury is common in autistic children and may contribute to abdominal discomfort, pain and observed aberrant behavior. Autistic behavior is often accompanied by numerous disturbing symptoms on the part of gastrointestinal system, such as abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea. Information on children's stool patterns and gut symptoms collected by questionnaire at 4 weeks and at 6, 18, 30 and 42 months of age were available for 12,984 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) Comparison of the ASD and control group during the first 3.5 years of life showed no major differences in stool colour or consistency, or in frequency of diarrhoea, constipation, bloody stools or abdominal pain. Constipation is a frequent finding in children with gastrointestinal symptoms and autism, particularly in the rectosigmoid colon, often with acquired megarectum. The absence of any correlation between the clinical history and the degree of fecal impaction in autistic children confirms the importance of an abdominal radiograph in the assessment of their degree of constipation. In a sample of 137 children, age 24-96 months, classified as having autism or ASD by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic, 24 percent had a history of at least one chronic gastrointestinal symptom.

Cyclophilin from Leishmania donovani (LdCyp) is a ubiquitous peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase Cyclophilins (CYPs) and FK506-binding proteins (FKBPs) are ubiquitous proteins belonging to the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) family.  However, their wide distribution and ubiquitous nature signifies their fundamental importance in plant survival. Cyclophilins (Cyps) are ubiquitous proteins that effect the cis-trans isomerization of Pro amide bonds, and are thus crucial to protein folding. FK506 binding proteins (FKBPs) and cyclophilins (CYPs) are abundant and ubiquitous proteins belonging to the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) superfamily, which regulate much of metabolism through a chaperone or an isomerization of proline residues during protein folding. Cyclophilin is a ubiquitous peptidyl prolyl cis/trans isomerase that plays critical roles in many biological processes. The receptor for cyclosporin is the protein cyclophilin, which is a ubiquitous peptidylprolyl isomerase.  Cyps (cyclophilins) are ubiquitous proteins of the immunophilin superfamily with proposed functions in protein folding, protein degradation, stress response and signal transduction.  Cyclophilins are folding helper enzymes belonging to the class of peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases; EC 5.2.1.8) that catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds in proteins. They are ubiquitous proteins present in almost all living organisms analyzed to date, with extremely rare exceptions. Immunophilins are ubiquitous enzymes responsible for proline isomerisation during protein synthesis and for the chaperoning of several membrane proteins. Cyclophilins (CyPs) are a large class of highly conserved ubiquitous peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerases. Cyclophilins belong to the family of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases (PPIases), which are ubiquitous and highly conserved enzymes capable of cis/trans isomerizing Xaa-Pro peptide bonds.  Originally identified as the cellular targets of immunosuppressant drugs, the immunophilins encompass two ubiquitous protein families: the FK-506 binding proteins or FKBPs, and the cyclosporin-binding proteins or cyclophilins.	yes

39	5895ec5e7d9090f353000015	Is there an association between Muenke Syndrome and FGFR3 gene mutation?	RESULTS: Forty-four with a positive FGFR3 mutation, median age 9 years, range 7 months to 52 years were enrolled. In addition, 10 unaffected siblings served as controls (5 males, 5 females; median age, 13 years; range, 3-18 years). Muenke is a fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR-3)-associated syndrome, which was first described in late 1990 s.  The syndrome is defined molecularly by a unique point mutation c.749C>G in exon 7 of the FGFR3 gene which results to an amino acid substitution p.Pro250Arg of the protein product.  Muenke syndrome caused by point mutation (C749G) in the FGFR3 gene affects 1 in 30,000 newborns and accounts for 25% to 30% of genetic causes of craniosynostosis. Phenotypic variability in two families of Muenke syndrome with FGFR3 mutation. PURPOSE: There are a number of craniosynostosis syndromes with hearing loss-including Muenke, Apert, Pfeiffer, Crouzon, Beare-Stevenson, Crouzon with acanthosis nigricans, and Jackson-Weiss syndromes-that result from mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes.  Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant craniosynostosis syndrome resulting from a defining point mutation in the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor3 (FGFR3) gene. Talocalcaneal coalition in Muenke syndrome: report of a patient, review of the literature in FGFR-related craniosynostoses, and consideration of mechanism. To better understand the pathophysiology of the Muenke syndrome, we present collective findings from several recent studies that have characterized a genetically equivalent mouse model for Muenke syndrome (FgfR3 (P244R)) and compare them with human phenotypes. We show in this study that knock-in mice harboring the mutation responsible for the Muenke syndrome (FgfR3(P244R)) display postnatal shortening of the cranial base along with synchondrosis growth plate dysfunction characterized by loss of resting, proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocyte zones and decreased Ihh expression. Muenke syndrome is caused by a single defining point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes. Epilepsy in Muenke syndrome: FGFR3-related craniosynostosis. Muenke syndrome (FGFR3-related craniosynostosis): expansion of the phenotype and review of the literature. The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes. PURPOSE: The Muenke syndrome mutation (FGFR3 (P250R)), which was discovered 15 years ago, represents the single most common craniosynostosis mutation. The heterozygous Pro250Arg substitution mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), which increases ligand-dependent signalling, is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans and defines Muenke syndrome. P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene also known as Muenke syndrome is associated with coronal craniosynostosis, sensorineural deafness, craniofacial, and digital abnormalities. Muenke syndrome caused by the FGFR3 Pro250Arg mutation is associated with craniosynostosis, hearing loss, and various bony anomalies. Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene. Muenke syndrome, defined by heterozygosity for a Pro250Arg substitution in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3), is the most common genetic cause of craniosynostosis in humans. In addition, sensorineural hearing loss is detected in all FgfR3 (P244R) mutant mice as in the majority of Muenke syndrome patients. Genetic testing identifies a pathogenic mutation or chromosomal abnormality in ∼ 21% of cases, but it is likely that further causative mutations remain to be discovered.To identify a shared signature of genetically determined craniosynostosis by comparing the expression patterns in three monogenic syndromes with a control group of patients with non-syndromic sagittal synostosis.Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2 substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no mutation detected) were cultured The craniosynostosis syndromes: Apert syndrome, Beare-Stevenson syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Muenke syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome and Saethre-Chotzen syndrome can be caused by mutation in either FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 Identical proline-->arginine gain-of-function mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1 (Pro252Arg), FGFR2 (Pro253Arg) and FGFR3 (Pro250Arg), result in type I Pfeiffer, Apert and Muenke craniosynostosis syndromes, respectively The Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene is found in patients with Muenke syndrome and is one of the most frequently encountered mutations in craniosynostosis syndromes Mutation analysis of FGFR-3 revealed a missense mutation in exon 6, c.749 C>G, with a resultant amino acid change from proline to arginine at codon 250 (P250R), in keeping with Muenke syndrome (Am J Hum Genet 1997;60:555-564) In an attempt to delineate functional features separating SCS from Muenkes syndrome, we screened patients presenting with coronal suture synostosis for mutations in the TWIST 1 gene, and for the Pro250Arg mutation in FGFR3 Since the Gly380Arg achondroplasia mutation was recognized, similar observations regarding the conserved nature of FGFR mutations and resulting phenotype have been made regarding other skeletal phenotypes, including hypochondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and Muenke coronal craniosynostosis Mutations in the gene that encodes Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) are associated with Achondroplasia (MIM 100800), Hypochondroplasia (MIM 146000), Muenke Syndrome (MIM 602849), Thanatophoric Dysplasia (MIM 187600, MIM 187601) and Lacrimo-Auriculo-Dento-Digital Syndrome (MIM 149730).Here we report a clinical and molecular study in a large cohort of 125 Portuguese patients with these skeletal disorders.  The Muenke syndrome (MS) is characterized by unicoronal or bicoronal craniosynostosis, midfacial hypoplasia, ocular hypertelorism, and a variety of minor abnormalities associated with a mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene.  P250R mutation in the FGFR3 gene also known as Muenke syndrome is associated with coronal craniosynostosis, sensorineural deafness, craniofacial, and digital abnormalities.  METHODS: Fibroblasts from 10 individuals each with Apert syndrome (FGFR2 substitution S252W), Muenke syndrome (FGFR3 substitution P250R), Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (various mutations in TWIST1) and non-syndromic sagittal synostosis (no mutation detected) were cultured.  Muenke syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by coronal suture craniosynostosis, hearing loss, developmental delay, carpal and tarsal fusions, and the presence of the Pro250Arg mutation in the FGFR3 gene.  Muenke syndrome, also known as FGFR3-associated coronal synostosis, is defined molecularly by the presence of a heterozygous nucleotide transversion, c.749C>G, encoding the amino acid substitution Pro250Arg, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 gene (FGFR3).  In spite of a variable phenotype, Muenke syndrome has been related to a unique mutation on the FGFR3 gene, Pro 250 to Arg, which is characteristic of this disease.  Skeletal analysis of the Fgfr3(P244R) mouse, a genetic model for the Muenke craniosynostosis syndrome. Muenke syndrome is caused by a single defining point mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. Epilepsy in Muenke syndrome: FGFR3-related craniosynostosis. Muenke syndrome, also known as FGFR3-associated coronal synostosis, is defined molecularly by the presence of a heterozygous nucleotide transversion, c.749C>G, encoding the amino acid substitution Pro250Arg, in the fibroblast growth factor receptor type 3 gene (FGFR3).

51	58dbba438acda3452900001c	Is Cri Du Chat associated with an expansion of a repeat with in the gene found on chromosome 5?	Cri-du-chat syndrome is a chromosomal disorder caused by a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5 The typical cri du chat syndrome, due to 5p15.2 deletion, includes severe intellectual disability, facial dysmorphisms, neonatal hypotonia and pre- and post-natal growth retardation, whereas more distal deletions in 5p15.3 lead to cat-like cry and speech delay and produce the clinical picture of the atypical cri du chat syndrome, with minimal or absent intellectual impairment. Cri-du-chat is a human contiguous gene deletion syndrome resulting from hemizygous deletions of chromosome 5p. Cri-du-chat is a chromosomal deletion syndrome characterized by partial deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5. The karyotype showed a terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5 including the critical region 5p15 for cri du chat syndrome. Fewer than 1 in 200 of cri du chat syndrome cases are due to recombination aneusomy arising from a parental inversion of chromosome 5. Molecular approach to analyzing the human 5p deletion syndrome, cri du chat. Cri-du-chat is a human contiguous gene deletion syndrome resulting from hemizygous deletions of chromosome 5p The cri du chat syndrome (CdCS) is a chromosomal deletion syndrome associated with a partial deletion of the short (p) arm of chromosome 5 The cri-du-chat syndrome is a contiguous gene syndrome that results from a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p). Cri-du-chat syndrome is associated with a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5. The deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5 is associated with the cri-du-chat syndrome. The Cri du Chat syndrome (CdCS) is a genetic disease resulting from a deletion of variable size occurring on the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p-). Cri-du-chat is a well described partial aneusomy resulting from deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5. Cri-du-chat syndrome is caused by haploinsufficiency of the genes on the distal part of the short arm of chromosome 5, and characteristic features include microcephaly, developmental delays, and a distinctive high-pitched mewing cry. The pathological condition of cri du chat syndrome is due to the cytogenetic deletion of band p15.2 of chromosome 5.   Karyotype analysis indicated that the patient has carried a terminal deletion in 5p. FISH with Cri du Chat syndrome region probe confirmed that D5S23 and D5S721 loci are deleted. 	no

60	5a8881118cb19eca6b000006	Has the proteome of mice hippocampus been analysed?	We employed a discovery-based proteomic approach in subcellular fractions of hippocampal tissue from chronic intermittent alcohol (CIE)-exposed C57Bl/6J mice to gain insight into alcohol-induced changes in GluN2B signaling complexes.   We employed shotgun liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) proteomic and metabonomic profiling approaches on prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampal (HPC) tissue from Df(16)A+/-mice, a model of the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.   Molecular alterations in the frontal cortex and hippocampus ofTsc1+/-and control mice, with or without rapamycin treatment, were investigated. A quantitative mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomic approach (LC-MSE) was employed as an unbiased method to detect changes in protein levels. This dataset reports on the analysis of mouse hippocampus by LC-MS/MS, from mice fed a diet that was either deficient in n-3 FA (n-3 Def) or sufficient in n-3 FA (n-3 Adq).  Using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and proteomic methods, here we identified learning-induced changes in the hippocampal proteome of non-transgenic (NonTg) and 3 × Tg-AD mice, a widely used animal model of AD. 	yes
64	5a737e233b9d13c70800000d	Does Enzastaurin improve survival of glioblastoma patients?	RESULTS: fourteen randomized clinical trials were identified (7 with bevacizumab, 2 cilengitide, 1 enzastaurin, 1 dasatinib, 1 vandetanib, 1 temsirolimus, 1 cediranib) including 4330 patients. Antiangiogenic drugs showed no improvement in overall survival with a pooled HR of 1.00, a trend for an inferior outcome, in terms of overall survival, was observed in the group of patients receiving antiangiogenic drug alone compared to cytotoxic drug alone (HR=1.24, p=0.056).  Enzastaurin (LY317615) in combination with bevacizumab for recurrent malignant gliomas is well-tolerated, with response and progression-free survival similar to bevacizumab monotherapy. So far, inhibition of angiogenesis by compounds such as bevacizumab, cediranib, enzastaurin or cilengitide as well as alternative dosing schedules of temozolomide did not prolong survival, neither at primary diagnosis nor at recurrent disease. Despite promising phase II clinical trial results and patient benefit in terms of clinical improvement and longer progression-free survival, an overall survival benefit has not been demonstrated in four randomized phase III trials of bevacizumab or cilengitide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma or cediranib or enzastaurin in recurrent glioblastoma. EXPERT OPINION: Enzastaurin and cediranib failed in randomized Phase III trials in recurrent glioblastoma, aflibercept in Phase II.  Enzastaurin was well tolerated and had a better hematologic toxicity profile but did not have superior efficacy compared with lomustine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Grade 3 to 4 hematologic toxicities were significantly higher with lomustine (46 events) than with enzastaurin (one event; P < or = .001).<br><b>CONCLUSION</b>: Enzastaurin was well tolerated and had a better hematologic toxicity profile but did not have superior efficacy compared with lomustine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.<br> Enzastaurin was well tolerated and had a better hematologic toxicity profile but did not have superior efficacy compared with lomustine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Enzastaurin has anti-glioma activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma, but does not appear to have enough single-agent activity to be useful as monotherapy. Enzastaurin (LY317615) in combination with bevacizumab for recurrent malignant gliomas is well-tolerated, with response and progression-free survival similar to bevacizumab monotherapy. CONCLUSION Enzastaurin was well tolerated and had a better hematologic toxicity profile but did not have superior efficacy compared with lomustine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. glioblastomas are highly vascularized tumors and various antiangiogenic drugs have been investigated in clinical trials showing unclear results we performed a systematic review and a meta analysis to clarify and evaluate their effectiveness in glioblastoma patients we searched relevant published and unpublished randomized clinical trials analyzing antiangiogenic drugs versus chemotherapy in

overall survival in glioblastoma patients either as first or second line treatment and either as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy among antiangiogenic drugs only bevacizumab improved progression free survival regardless of treatment line both as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. glioblastoma is characterized by high expression levels of proangiogenic cytokines and microvascular proliferation highlighting the potential value of treatments targeting angiogenesis antiangiogenic treatment likely achieves a beneficial impact through multiple mechanisms of action ultimately however alternative proangiogenic signal transduction pathways are activated leading to the development of resistance even in tumors that initially respond the identification of biomarkers or imaging parameters to predict response and to herald resistance is of high priority despite promising phase ii clinical trial results and patient benefit in terms of clinical improvement and longer progression free survival an overall survival benefit has not been demonstrated in four randomized phase iii trials of bevacizumab or cilengitide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma or cediranib or enzastaurin in recurrent glioblastoma however future studies are warranted predictive markers may allow appropriate patient enrichment combination with chemotherapy may ultimately prove successful in improving overall survival and novel agents targeting multiple proangiogenic pathways may prove effective. this phase iii open label study compared the efficacy and safety of enzastaurin versus lomustine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma who grade 4 patients were randomly assigned 2 1 to receive 6 week cycles of enzastaurin 500 mg d 1 125 mg loading dose day 1 or lomustine 100 to 130
