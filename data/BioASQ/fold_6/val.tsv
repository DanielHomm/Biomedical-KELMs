9	54f08d4a94afd61504000016	Is irritable bowel syndrome more common in women with endometriosis?	CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid pain syndromes, mood conditions and asthma are common in adolescents and young women with endometriosis. There are many etiologies of pelvic pain that present with symptoms resembling those of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain that are not diagnosable with laparoscopy, such as interstitial cystitis and irritable bowel syndrome. Often, such patients are labelled with irritable bowel syndrome.  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis.  RESULTS: Compared with controls, patients with minimal to mild and moderate to severe endometriosis had a higher prevalence of symptoms consistent with IBS (0% vs 65% and 50%, respectively, p<0.001) with significantly lower mean pain thresholds (39.5 mm Hg (95% CI 36.0 to 43.0) vs 28.1 mm Hg (95% CI 24.5 to 31.6), p=0.001 and 28.8 mm Hg (95% CI 24.9 to 32.6), p=0.002) not explained by differences in rectal compliance.  Similarly, women with a history of irritable bowel syndrome were twice as likely to develop endometriosis [AOR=1.9, 95% CI (1.03-3.87)]. A weak association between reported family history of endometriosis and history of irritable bowel syndrome and the development of endometriosis was also observed.  Irritable bowel syndrome and chronic constipation in patients with endometriosis. Fifteen per cent of the patients with endometriosis also had IBS and 14% of the patients with endometriosis had functional constipation without IBS. CONCLUSION: In patients with endometriosis, 29% also had IBS or constipation.  Seventy-six women (21.4%) had previously been diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and 79% of them had endometriosis confirmed. Compared with controls, women with endometriosis had increased risks of abdominopelvic pain (OR 5.2 [95% CI: 4.7-5.7]), dysmenorrhoea (OR 8.1 [95% CI: 7.2-9.3]), menorrhagia (OR 4.0 [95% CI: 3.5-4.5]), subfertility (OR 8.2 [95% CI: 6.9-9.9]), dyspareunia and/or postcoital bleeding (OR 6.8 [95% CI: 5.7-8.2]), and ovarian cysts (OR 7.3 [95% CI: 5.7-9.4]), and of being diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (OR 1.6 [95% CI: 1.3-1.8]) or pelvic inflammatory disease (OR 3.0 [95% CI: 2.5-3.6]). Endometriosis may coexist with or be misdiagnosed as pelvic inflammatory disease or IBS. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, women with endometriosis were 3.5 times more likely to have received a diagnosis of IBS (OR 3.5 [95% CI: 3.1-3.9]). Even after women had been diagnosed with endometriosis, they were still two and a half times more likely to receive a new diagnosis of IBS when compared with the controls (OR 2.5 [95% CI: 2.2-2.8]). CONCLUSIONS: Women with endometriosis are more likely to be diagnosed with IBS and PID than controls, even after a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis has been reached. In women, clinical studies suggest that functional pain syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis, and fibromyalgia, are co-morbid with endometriosis, chronic pelvic pain, and others diseases. In women, clinical studies suggest that pain syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome and interstitial cystitis, which are associated with visceral hyperalgesia, are often comorbid with endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain.  Depression, anxiety, IBS, FM, CFS, and IC were more common in migraine with EM group than in controls. Intestinal endometriosis can mimic many gastrointestinal diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, infections and neoplasms. Endometriosis is often associated with other painful conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis and fibromyalgia.  CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of endometriosis should be considered in women with recurrent monthly abdominal pain and bowel symptoms, especially if accompanied by gynaecologic complaints, even because the significant symptoms overlap with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and makes the differentiation extremely difficult. Intestinal endometriosis is typically asymptomatic; however, when symptoms occur, they can mimic those of irritable bowel syndrome.  Similarly, women with a history of irritable bowel syndrome were twice as likely to develop endometriosis [AOR=1. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is also common in this setting, and it was speculated that the visceral hypersensitivity associated with this condition might be amplifying the symptoms of endometriosis.	yes
10	531d2aa5267d7dd053000003	Does BNP increase after intensive exercise in athletes?	NT-pro-BNP was significantly elevated postexercise in both adults and adolescents and remained above baseline at 24 h in both groups. NT-pro-BNP concentrations increased significantly (28 +/- 17.1 vs 795 +/- 823 ng x L, P < 0.05), whereas postrace cTnT were elevated in just five athletes (20%). [NT-pro-BNP] was observed immediately after the marathon (median [NT-pro-BNP] before: 39.6 pg ml(-1), after: 138.6 pg ml(-1), p=0.003) with a further increase on day one. [BNP] did not increase immediately after the marathon but increased on day one (median [BNP] before: 15 pg ml(-1), day one: 27.35 pg ml(-1), p=0.006). Pro-BNP was significantly increased immediately post-race (27+/-21 vs 7+/-2 pmol/L pre-race, P < or = 0.007), which 12-24 h later, decreased to 19+/-14 pmol/L (P = 0.07 vs pre-race). The relatively high NT-proBNP levels after active recovery when psychophysical stress is higher, because of cycling and cold water immersion, suggest that not only endurance exercise, but also strenuous, stressful short exercise can induce an increase in NT-proBNP concentrations. Running a marathon significantly increases NT-pro-BNP levels in healthy adults. This increase could be partially attributed to cardiac stress. Increases in NT-proBNP can be found in a major part of obviously healthy athletes after prolonged strenuous exercise. The release of BNP during and after exercise may not result from myocardial damage but may have cytoprotective and growth-regulating effects. The different nature of exercise-induced increases in BNP and cardiac troponins has to be elucidated in the future. In healthy cyclists, transient increases in NT-pro-BNP and cTnT are more likely to reflect cardiac fatigue than injury. The rise in BNP in older athletes may reflect a reversible, mainly diastolic left ventricular dysfunction.  Plasma BNP concentrations were higher in both the judo and marathon groups than in controls, and positively correlated with LV mass as well as with deceleration time. Such exercise significantly increased ANP and BNP levels in healthy men, and the increases could be partially attributed to myocardial damage during the race.	yes

20	56d8b27651531f7e33000003	Do patients with Pendred syndrome present congenital deafness?	Pendred Syndrome can be characterized by the triad composed of familial goitre, abnormal perchlorate discharge and congenital deafness. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and goiter.  Pendred syndrome comprises congenital sensorineural hearing loss, thyroid goiter, and positive perchlorate discharge test.  The cause of the congenital deafness in Pendred syndrome is obscure, although a Mondini type malformation of the cochlea exists in some patients. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and goiter. Pendred syndrome is the autosomal recessively transmitted association of familial goiter and congenital deafness. Pendred syndrome (PDS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness, goiter and iodide organification defect. Pendred syndrome is a recessively inherited disorder with the hallmark features of congenital deafness and thyroid goitre. Pendred syndrome, a common autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by congenital deafness and goiter, is caused by mutations of SLC26A4, which codes for pendrin. These studies provide compelling evidence that defects in pendrin cause Pendred syndrome thereby launching a new area of investigation into thyroid physiology, the pathogenesis of congenital deafness and the role of altered sulphate transport in human disease. Mutations in the Pendred syndrome gene have been observed in patients with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation, in the absence of other Pendred syndrome features. The occurrence of congenital deafness, mutism and goitre unassociated with cretinism or mental retardation in euthyroid patients is known as Pendred's Syndrome. The autosomal recessive Pendred's syndrome is defined by congenital sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification. Pendred's syndrome is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by goiter, impaired iodide organification, and congenital sensorineural deafness. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by congenital sensorineural deafness, goiter, and impaired iodide organification. Pendred's syndrome is manifested by congenital sensorineural deafness in association with familial goiter due to defective organic binding of iodine in the thyroid gland. Although the textbook view of the Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterised by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all patients present this classical clinical description. Pendred's syndrome may account for up to 10% of the cases with hereditary hearing loss, and pendrin mutations have also been found in a kindred with non-syndromic deafness. Pendred syndrome comprises the association of severe congenital sensorineural deafness with thyroid pathology. The first one is named Pendred Syndrome (PS) when deafness is associated with thyroid goiter; the second is called DFNB4, when no other symptoms are present. Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by sensorineural deafness, a partial defect in iodide organification, and dyshormonogenetic goiter. Pendred syndrome and non-syndromic recessive deafness associated with enlarged vestibular aqueduct (NSRD with EVA) are caused by mutations in the SLC26A4 (PDS) gene. Although the textbook view of Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterized by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all such patients present this classical clinical picture.  The occurrence of congenital deafness, mutism and goitre unassociated with cretinism or mental retardation in euthyroid patients is known as Pendred's Syndrome.  The cause of the congenital deafness in Pendred syndrome is obscure, although a Mondini type malformation of the cochlea exists in some patients.  The discovery of mutations in the SLC26A4 gene in patients with Pendred syndrome (congenital deafness, goiter, and defective iodide organification) suggested a possible role for the encoded protein, pendrin, as an apical iodide transporter.  Pendred syndrome is a recessively inherited disorder with the hallmark features of congenital deafness and thyroid goitre.  Pendred&apos;s syndrome is manifested by congenital sensorineural deafness in association with familial goiter due to defective organic binding of iodine in the thyroid gland. The majority of patients with Pendred&apos;s syndrome are euthyroid. We report on an unusual case of a patient with Pendred&apos;s syndrome presenting with amenorrhea and late-onset hypothyroidism.  Although the textbook view of Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterized by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all such patients present this classical clinical picture. Malformations of the inner ear, specifically enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, are common in Pendred syndrome and mutations in the PDS (Pendred Syndrome) gene have been recorded in patients presenting with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation only, without other features of Pendred syndrome. The occurrence of congenital deafness, mutism and goitre unassociated with cretinism or mental retardation in euthyroid patients is known as Pendred&apos;s Syndrome. It has been estimated that 4-10 % of children with congenital deafness suffer from this condition. Malformations of the inner ear, specifically enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, are common in Pendred syndrome and mutations in the PDS (Pendred Syndrome) gene have been recorded in patients presenting with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation only, without other features of Pendred syndrome. Since this is the most common radiological malformation of the cochlea in deaf patients, we investigated what proportion of such cases were due to mutation of the PDS gene. Although the textbook view of Pendred syndrome is that of an autosomal recessive condition characterized by deafness and goitre, it is increasingly clear that not all such patients present this classical clinical picture. Malformations of the inner ear, specifically enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct, are common in Pendred syndrome and mutations in the PDS (Pendred Syndrome) gene have been recorded in patients presenting with deafness and vestibular aqueduct dilatation only, without other features of Pendred syndrome.	yes
32	56f3f6b12ac5ed145900001a	Is GAGA associated with nucleosome-free regions (NFR)?	One of the three nuclease hypersensitive sites in the Fab-7 boundary, HS1, contains multiple consensus-binding sequences for the GAGA factor, a protein known to be involved in the formation and/or maintenance of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin. The HS3 sequence contains consensus binding sites for the GAGA factor, a protein implicated in the formation of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin, and Pleiohomeotic (Pho), a Polycomb group protein that is related to the mammalian transcription factor YY1. The interactions of GAGA factor and heat shock factor with their binding sites in chromatin occurred in two modes. Their interaction with binding sites in the nucleosome-free regions did not require ATP. In the presence of ATP both factors interacted also with nucleosomal binding sites, causing nucleosome rearrangements and a refinement of nucleosome positions While chromatin remodeling upon transcription factor interaction has previously been interpreted to involve nucleosome disruption, the data suggest energy-dependent nucleosome sliding as main principle of chromatin reorganization.  These (CT)n repeats are associated with a nonhistone protein(s) in vivo and are bound by a purified Drosophila protein, the GAGA factor, in vitro. This (CT)n element appears to contribute to formation of the wild-type chromatin structure of hsp26, an organized nucleosome array that leaves the HSEs in nucleosome-free, DNase I-hypersensitive (DH) site The HS3 sequence contains consensus binding sites for the GAGA factor, a protein implicated in the formation of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin, and Pleiohomeotic (Pho), a Polycomb group protein that is related to the mammalian transcription factor YY1. One of the three nuclease hypersensitive sites in the Fab-7 boundary, HS1, contains multiple consensus-binding sequences for the GAGA factor, a protein known to be involved in the formation and/or maintenance of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin. The iab-7 polycomb response element maps to a nucleosome-free region of chromatin and requires both GAGA and pleiohomeotic for silencing activity. The HS3 sequence contains consensus binding sites for the GAGA factor, a protein implicated in the formation of nucleosome-free regions of chromatin, and Pleiohomeotic (Pho), a Polycomb group protein that is related to the mammalian transcription factor YY1. 	yes
40	54ede5df94afd61504000007	Is there an increased risk for cancer in Dyskeratosis Congenita?	"People with DC are at increased risk for progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), solid tumors (usually squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck or anogenital cancer), and pulmonary fibrosis Clinical progression of the disease can lead to aplastic anemia (86% of all patients) and to pulmonary or hepatic complications. These patients also have an increased risk of cancer. Fanconi anaemia (FA), dyskeratosis congenita (DC), Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA), and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) comprise major inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS). Adverse events include severe bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and solid tumours (ST) Patients with FA had earlier onset of cancers, need for stem cell transplant, and death; followed by DC; DBA and SDS were mildest. While FA and DC patients had markedly increased risks of cancer, AML and MDS, there were no cases of leukaemia in DBA or SDS patients The findings demonstrate that both FA and DC are major cancer susceptibility syndromes People with DC are at increased risk for progressive bone marrow failure (BMF), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), solid tumors (usually squamous cell carcinoma of the head/neck or anogenital cancer), and pulmonary fibrosis Patients with dyskeratosis congenita (DC) have an increased risk of cancer, but also exhibit heightened radiation sensitivity. Dyskeratosis congenita (DC) is characterized by the clinical triad of reticular skin pigmentation, oral leukoplakia, and nail dystrophy associated with bone marrow failure (BMF) and an high risk to develop cancer and pulmonary complications. CONCLUSION: Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare condition; however, it is vital to recognise the increased risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancers in these patients. Point mutations in the DKC1 gene that encodes dyskerin cause the rare inherited syndrome called X-linked dyskeratosis congenita, characterized by a failure of proliferating tissues and increased susceptibility to cancer. Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC) also known as Zinsser-Engman-Cole syndrome is a rare multi-system bone marrow failure syndrome characterised by mucocutaneous abnormalities and an increased predisposition to cancer"". Dyskeratosis congenita is an inherited syndrome characterised by mucocutaneous features, bone marrow failure, an increased risk of malignancy and other somatic abnormalities. Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare condition; however, it is vital to recognise the increased risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancers in these patients. Epidermal atrophy, hair growth defects, bone marrow failure and increased risk of cancer are also common in DC patients.

53	5512cce26a8cde6b7200000c	Is protein M3/6 a dual specificity phosphatase?	Involvement of the dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 in c-Jun N-terminal kinase inactivation following cerebral ischemia in the rat hippocampus. The results revealed upregulation of dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) activity at 4 h of reperfusion in rat hippocampi.  This study examines the molecular mechanism underlying JNK dephosphorylation and inactivation evoked by dual-specificity phosphates following cerebral ischemia. Phosphatases play a particularly important role in this respect, by tightly controlling MAPK phosphorylation and activation. M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK and, to a lesser extent, p38 MAPKs and is found in a complex with these kinases, along with other pathway components, held together by scaffold proteins.  Dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) play a very important role in these events by modulating the extent of JNK phosphorylation and activation and thus regulating cellular responses to stress. M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK. M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK [7, 8].  Here we describe two new dual specificity phosphatases of the CL100/MKP-1 family that are selective for inactivating ERK or JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases when expressed in COS-7 cells. M3/6 is the first phosphatase of this family to display highly specific inactivation of JNK/SAPK and p38 MAP kinases.  We previously demonstrated that the dual specificity phosphatases (DSPs) MKP7 and M3/6 bind the scaffold JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1) and inactivate the bound subset of JNK (1). the dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6  dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) M3/6 (DUSP8) is a dual-specificity phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation and inactivation of JNK  the M3/6 dual-specificity phosphatase M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK The dual specificity phosphatases M3/6 and MKP-3 are highly selective for inactivation of distinct mitogen-activated protein kinases. Phosphorylation of the M3/6 dual-specificity phosphatase enhances the activation of JNK by arsenite. Indeed, expanded polyglutamine impaired the solubility of the dual-specificity JNK phosphatase M3/6. Regulation of dual-specificity phosphatases M3/6 and hVH5 by phorbol esters. M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK. M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK [7, 8] M3/6 (DUSP8) is one of the dual-specificity protein phosphatases with distinct specificity towards JNK Here we describe how diverse cellular stresses affect differently the stability and activity of a JNK-inactivating dual-specificity threonine-tyrosine phosphatase M3/6 M3/6 is a dual-specificity phosphatase selective for JNK [7, 8] Regulation of dual-specificity phosphatases M3/6 and hVH5 by phorbol esters.

56	530cf57efe2466f70c000006	Has vitamin D has been shown to reduce incidence of falls in older people in clinical trials?	However, apart from the beneficial effects of 800 IU/d of vitamin D3 for reduction of falls in the elderly, causality remains yet unproven in randomized controlled trials (RCTs).  The rate of falls and the number of fallers was significantly reduced in two studies evaluating the effect of medication on preventing falls; one study (85 participants) compared vitamin D versus placebo in institutionalised women after stroke with low vitamin D levels, and the other study (79 participants) evaluated alendronate versus alphacalcidol in hospitalised people after stroke. Two studies testing vitamin D versus placebo and alendronate versus alphacalcidol found a significant reduction in falls and the number of people falling .Overall, vitamin D supplementation does not appear to reduce falls but may be effective in people who have lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Overall, vitamin D did not reduce rate of falls (RaR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.11; seven trials; 9324 participants) or risk of falling (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.03; 13 trials; 26,747 participants), but may do so in people with lower vitamin D levels before treatment. Vitamin D affects bone and muscle health and likely reduces the risk of falls in the elderly. We found 26 eligible trials of moderate quality that enrolled 45,782 participants, the majority of which were elderly and female. Vitamin D use was associated with statistically significant reduction in the risk of falls (odds ratio for suffering at least one fall, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.96) This effect was more prominent in patients who were vitamin D deficient at baseline and in studies in which calcium was coadministered with vitamin D. Vitamin D combined with calcium reduces the risk of falls. The majority of the evidence is derived from trials enrolling elderly women. Studies of vitamin D and calcium for fracture prevention have produced inconsistent results, as a result of different vitamin D status and calcium intake at baseline, different doses and poor to adequate compliance. Despite significant increases in the provision of hip protectors and use of vitamin D supplementation in both intervention and control facilities, there was no difference in the number of falls or falls injuries between the intervention and control groups, nor a reduction in falls overall. Beyond fall and fracture prevention, vitamin D may also reduce overall morbidity by multiple mechanisms.  There is evidence to suggest that these agents may reduce the incidence of nonvertebral fractures and falls; however, their benefit on vertebral fracture reduction may depend on the type of active vitamin D. 	yes
64	5325de7d9b2d7acc7e000029	Is low T3 syndrome a prognostic marker in patients with renal insufficiency?	Low T3 was particularly common (44.3 %), and clearly associated with increased 6- and 12-month mortality and decreased overall survival (log rank test, P=0.007).  Increased rT3 may be more common in ESRD patients than previously described, and together with decreased T3 it may serve as an indicator of poor prognosis in subsequent months. The presence of TFT alterations seems to not be associated with clinical and prognostic implications in AKI patients. Multivariate analysis, according to receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, showed that mortality was best predicted by total triiodothyronine (T3). Finally, low T3 but not low free triiodothyronine was associated with worse all-cause (Likelihood ratio = 45.4; P < 0.0001) and cardiovascular mortality (Likelihood ratio = 47.8; P < 0.0001) after adjustment for confounding factors.  In Cox analyses, fT3 was a significant predictor of mortality independent of the main traditional as well as non-traditional risk factors. All-cause and CV mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with 'lower' T3 levels than in the 'higher' T3 group (113.4 vs 18.2 events per 1000 patient-years, P<0.001, and 49.8 vs 9.1 events per 1000 patient-years, P=0.001, respectively). The Kaplan-Meier analysis also showed significantly worse cumulative survival rates in the 'lower' T3 group (P<0.001). In the Cox regression analysis, low T3 was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality even after adjusting for traditional risk factors (hazard ratio=3.76, P=0.021).  In CKD patients with proteinuria, low T3 concentration predicted all-cause mortality and cardiovascular event independently of the severity of proteinuria. Low-T3 syndrome is a frequent finding among HD patients, but it does not predict outcome. However, serum fT3 level is a strong and inverse mortality predictor, in part explained by its underlying association with nutritional state and inflammation. These data suggest that low FT3 levels are not predictive for mortality in a subgroup of stable HD patients who could survive more than 12 months. Low fT3 is an independent predictor of death in hemodialysis patients. These data lend support to the hypothesis that thyroid dysfunction is implicated in the high risk of the ESRD population.	yes

99	530cefaaad0bf1360c000004	Is bapineuzumab effective for treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease?	 Thus far, results from two large phase 3 trial programs with bapineuzumab and solaneuzumab, respectively, have brought rather disappointing results. More recently, in phase III studies, bapineuzumab has been discontinued because it did not prove clinically effective (despite its significant effect on biomarkers), while solaneuzumab has been found effective in slowing AD progression.  Passive immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against Aβ is in late clinical development but recently the two most advanced mAbs, Bapineuzumab and Solanezumab, targeting an N-terminal or central epitope, respectively, failed to meet their target of improving or stabilizing cognition and function. The marginal effects observed in recent clinical studies of solanezumab, targeting monomeric Aβ, and bapineuzumab, targeting amyloid plaques, prompted expert comments that drug discovery efforts in Alzheimer's disease should focus on soluble forms of Aβ rather than fibrillar Aβ deposits found in amyloid plaques. Phase III trials showed that bapineuzumab failed to improve cognitive and functional performances in AD patients, and was associated with a high incidence of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Clinical trials on various drugs, including AN1792, bapineuzumab, and solanezumab, have been carried out; however, all trials have failed to demonstrate apparent clinical benefits.  Despite the alteration in biochemical composition, all 3 immunized subjects exhibited continued cognitive decline. Despite negative topline phase 3 clinical trial results for bapineuzumab and solanezumab in mild to moderate AD, findings from these trials and recent advances suggest renewed optimism for anti-amyloid therapies.  The lack of progress in the development of disease-modifying therapy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) was highlighted recently by the cessation of a phase 3 clinical trial studying the effects of bapineuzumab on mild to moderate disease. No treatment benefit was apparent, whereas several serious side effects occurred more commonly in the treatment group compared to placebo.  Clinical studies using the N-terminal-directed anti-Aβ antibody bapineuzumab have demonstrated reduced brain PET-Pittsburg-B signals, suggesting the reduction of Aβ plaques, and reduced levels of total and phosphorylated tau protein in the CSF of treated AD patients. Preclinical studies using 3D6 (the murine form of bapineuzumab) have demonstrated resolution of Aβ plaque and vascular burdens, neuritic dystrophy, and preservation of synaptic density in the transgenic APP mouse models. The clinical results of the initial studies with bapineuzumab were equivocal in terms of cognitive benefit. The occurrence of vasogenic edema after bapineuzumab, and more rarely brain microhemorrhages (especially in Apo E ε4 carriers), has raised concerns on the safety of these antibodies directed against the N-terminus of the Aβ peptide.   The most advanced of these immunological approaches is bapineuzumab, composed of humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies, that has been tested in two Phase II trials, demonstrating to reduce Aβ burden in the brain of AD patients. However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab appears uncertain. The occurrence of vasogenic edema, especially in apolipoprotein E 4 carriers, may limit its clinical use and have led to abandon the highest dose of the drug (2 mg/kg). However, the preliminary cognitive efficacy of bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody, appears uncertain. Moreover, the occurrence of vasogenic edema and, more rarely, brain microhemorrhages, especially in apolipoprotein E ϵ4 carriers, have led to abandoning of the highest dose of the drug.  However, the preliminary equivocal cognitive results obtained with bapineuzumab as well as the detrimental cognitive effects observed with semagacestat, a potent γ-secretase inhibitor, raise the possibility that targeting Aβ may not be clinically efficacious in AD.  The patient received four bapineuzumab infusions over a 39 week period. During the course of this treatment, there was no remarkable change in cognitive impairment as determined by MMSE scores. Forty-eight days after the fourth bapineuzumab infusion was given, MRI revealed that the patient had developed lacunar infarcts and possible vasogenic edema, probably related to immunotherapy, but a subsequent MRI scan 38 days later demonstrated resolution of vasogenic edema. The patient expired due to acute congestive heart failure complicated by progressive AD and cerebrovascular accident 378 days after the first bapineuzumab infusion and 107 days after the end of therapy. Neuropathological and biochemical analysis did not produce evidence of lasting plaque regression or clearance of Aβ due to immunotherapy. These results suggest that, in this particular case, bapineuzumab immunotherapy neither resulted in detectable clearance of amyloid plaques nor prevented further cognitive impairment. Bapineuzumab has been shown to reduce Aβ burden in the brain of AD patients. However, its preliminary cognitive efficacy appears uncertain, particularly in ApoE ε4 carriers, and vasogenic edema may limit its clinical use.  Bapineuzumab appears capable of reducing the cerebral beta-amyloid peptide burden in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, particularly in APOE 4 carriers, its ability to slow disease progression remains uncertain, and vasogenic edema - a dose-limiting and potentially severe adverse reaction - may limit its clinical applicability. The first is a phase 2 study of passive immunotherapy with bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-Abeta monoclonal antibody directed against the N-terminus of Abeta. This trial showed no differences within dose cohorts on the primary efficacy analysis. Exploratory analyses showed potential treatment differences on cognitive and functional endpoints in study completers and apolipoprotein E epsilon4 noncarriers. A safety concern was the occurrence of reversible vasogenic edema.  The first passive immunotherapy trial with bapineuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against the end terminus of Abeta, also encountered some dose dependent adverse events during the Phase II portion of the study, vasogenic edema in 12 cases, which were significantly over represented in ApoE4 carriers.	no
106	56e05a7b51531f7e3300000d	Does PU.1 (SPI1) affect NF-kB binding?	Recent data demonstrate that developmental transcription factors like the macrophage fate-determining Pu.1 set the stage for the activity of ubiquitous transcription factors activated by inflammatory stimuli, like NF-kB, AP-1, and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs). Within 1217 bp of upstream sequence, 3 sites for NF-kB, 10 sites for NF-IL6, 15 sites for AP1, 6 sites for AP4, 2 sites for CHOP/CEBP alpha and 1 site for SP1 and PU.1 were identified. As little as 82 bp of upstream sequence gave relatively strong luciferase activity, a region containing both a PU.1 and NF-kB site. Potential transcription regulatory elements, AP1, AP2, AP3, NF-kB and GATA recognition sequences, are located within 523 bp upstream of the p35 gene; however, no TATA box was identified. The p40 subunit gene consists of eight exons. A TATA box is located 30 bp upstream from the transcription start site, and AP1, AP3, GATA, and Pu.1 recognition sequences are located within 690 bp upstream of the p40 gene. Several putative binding sequences for ubiquitous (Sp1, AP-1, AP-2, and NF-kB) and leukocyte-specific (PU.1) transcription factors have been identified in the proximal region of the CD11c promoter which may participate in the regulation of the expression of p150,95. PU.1 is regulated by NF-kappaB through a novel binding site in a 17 kb upstream enhancer element.	yes

115	56c44ce83aaba2a675000001	Are there transposon-free regions in mammalian genomes?	"Transposon-free regions in mammalian genomes. Despite the presence of over 3 million transposons separated on average by approximately 500 bp, the human and mouse genomes each contain almost 1000 transposon-free regions (TFRs) over 10 kb in length. The majority of human TFRs correlate with orthologous TFRs in the mouse, despite the fact that most transposons are lineage specific. Many human TFRs also overlap with orthologous TFRs in the marsupial opossum, indicating that these regions have remained refractory to transposon insertion for long evolutionary periods. Over 90% of the bases covered by TFRs are noncoding, much of which is not highly conserved. Most TFRs are not associated with unusual nucleotide composition, but are significantly associated with genes encoding developmental regulators, suggesting that they represent extended regions of regulatory information that are largely unable to tolerate insertions, a conclusion difficult to reconcile with current conceptions of gene regulation. All three elements insert only rarely within many Polycomb-regulated regions, a property that may contribute to the origin of ""transposon-free regions"" (TFRs) in metazoan genomes. Despite the presence of over 3 million transposons separated on average by approximately 500 bp, the human and mouse genomes each contain almost 1000 transposon-free regions (TFRs) over 10 kb in length.

131	56f7c44109dd18d46b000013	Is Kanzaki disease associated with deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase?	Kanzaki disease (OMIM#104170) is attributable to a deficiency in alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA; E.C.3.2.1.49), which hydrolyzes GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser/Thr.   Our findings suggest that the association of alpha-NAGA with its substrates is strongly affected by the amino acid substitution at R329 and that the association with GalNAcalpha1-O-Thr is more highly susceptible to structural changes. The residual mutant enzyme in R329W could not associate with GalNAcalpha1-O-Thr and GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser. However, the residual mutant enzyme in R329Q catalyzed GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser to some extent. Therefore, the urinary ratio of GalNAcalpha1-O-Ser:GalNAcalpha1-O-Thr was lower and the clinical phenotype was milder in the R329Q mutation.

135	5501b3b3e9bde69634000007	Is phospholamban a regulatory/inhibitory protein of the Ca ATPase SERCA?	The membrane protein complex between the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) and phospholamban (PLN) controls Ca(2+) transport in cardiomyocytes, thereby modulating cardiac contractility. β-Adrenergic-stimulated phosphorylation of PLN at Ser-16 enhances SERCA activity via an unknown mechanism. Phospholamban (PLN) is a type II membrane protein that inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), thereby regulating calcium homeostasis in cardiac muscle. In membranes, PLN forms pentamers that have been proposed to function either as a storage for active monomers or as ion channels. Regulation of the SERCA calcium pump by phospholamban (PLB) is largely due to interactions between their respective transmembrane domains. In spite of numerous mutagenesis and kinetic studies, we still do not have a clear mechanistic picture of how PLB influences the calcium transport cycle of SERCA. Calcium transport across the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) plays an important role in the regulation of heart muscle contraction and relaxation. The sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) 2a is responsible for Ca(2+) up-take by this organelle and is inhibited in a reversible manner by phospholamban, another SR membrane protein. Thus, alleviation of phospholamban-mediated inhibition of SERCA2a is a potential therapeutic option for heart failure and cardiomyopathy. Phospholamban has been suggested to be a key regulator of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca cycling and contractility and a potential therapeutic target in restoring the depressed Ca cycling in failing hearts. In larger mammals, a higher fraction of SERCA2a pumps are regulated by phospholamban, and this may influence therapeutic strategies to enhance cardiac contractility and functional cardiac reserve. Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), and this inhibition is relieved by Ca(2+) calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) phosphorylation These findings suggest that PLB is an important modulator of gastric antrum smooth muscle contractility by modulation of SR Ca(2+) release and CaM kinase II activity. The function of the SERCA pump is modulated by the endogenous molecules phospholamban (PLB) and sarcolipin (SLN), expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. The mechanism of action of PLB on SERCA is well characterized, whereas that of SLN is only beginning to be understood.   Phospholamban (PLB) is an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA). These results show that alteration of the PLB:SERCA ratio can significantly modulate smooth muscle [Ca2+]i. Phospholamban expressed in cardiac muscle and sarcolipin expressed in skeletal muscle regulate SERCA activity. Phospholamban (PLB) is a 24- to 27-kDa phosphoprotein that modulates activity of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase (SERCA). Expression of PLB is reportedly limited to cardiac, slow-twitch skeletal and smooth muscle in which PLB is an important regulator of [Ca2+]i and contractility in these muscles. Regulation of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA 2a) depends on the phosphorylation state of phospholamban (PLB). When PLB is phosphorylated, its inhibitory effect towards SERCA 2a is relieved, leading to an enhanced myocardial performance.   Ca(2+) reuptake occurs via sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) and is regulated by the inhibitory protein phospholamban (PLB) in many cell types. Phospholamban (PLN) is a small integral membrane protein, which binds and inhibits in a yet unknown fashion the Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Phospholamban (PLN) is the endogenous inhibitor of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA), the integral membrane enzyme responsible for 70�% of the removal of Ca(2+) from the cytosol, inducing cardiac muscle relaxation in humans. Phospholamban (PLB) is an integral membrane protein regulating Ca(2+) transport through inhibitory interaction with sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). Phosphorylation by protein kinase A and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (PLN), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA). Phosphorylation by protein kinase A and dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 modulate the inhibitory activity of phospholamban (PLN), the endogenous regulator of the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium Ca(2+) ATPase (SERCA) We used EPR spectroscopy to probe directly the interaction between phospholamban (PLB) and its regulatory target, the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA)	yes
138	56c095b7ef6e394741000025	Is there an association between TERT promoter mutation and survival of glioma patients?	Mutations lead to TERT upregulation and are associated with aggressive clinical behavior in glioblastomas. Kaplan-Meier's survival analysis showed that TERT promoter mutation (P=0.037), Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation (P<0.001), and 1p/19q codeletion (P<0.001) were associated with favorable overall survival (OS). In the subset of 116 IDH-mutated lower-grade gliomas lacking 1p/19q codeletion, 19 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.027) and OS (P=0.004). Consistent with this observation, in the subset of 97 IDH-mutated astrocytomas, 14 TERT promoter-mutated tumors showed longer PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.001). In contrast, among the subset of 74 IDH wild-type lower-grade gliomas with intact 1p/19q, TERT promoter mutation was associated with shorter PFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.001). Similarly, in the subset of 65 IDH wild-type astrocytomas, 16 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited unfavorable PFS (P=0.007) and OS (P=0.008). Our results indicate that when combined with IDH status, TERT promoter mutation contributes to prognostic subgroups of lower-grade astrocytic tumors or 1p/19q intact lower-grade gliomas and this may further refine future molecular classification of lower-grade gliomas. RESULTS: TERTp-mut identified in 60.8% of gliomas (491 out of 807) was globally associated with poorer outcome (Hazard ratio (HR)=1.50).  TERT promoter mutations lead to high transcriptional activity under hypoxia and temozolomide treatment and predict poor prognosis in gliomas. Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age. TERT promoter mutations maintained its ability of inducing high transcriptional activity even under hypoxic and TMZ treatment conditions, and the presence of mutations was associated with poor prognosis in glioma patients.  Patients whose Grade III-IV gliomas exhibit TERT promoter mutations alone predominately have primary GBMs associated with poor median OS (11.5 months). Patients whose Grade III-IV gliomas exhibit IDH1/2 mutations alone predominately have astrocytic morphologies and exhibit a median OS of 57 months while patients whose tumors exhibit both TERT promoter and IDH1/2 mutations predominately exhibit oligodendroglial morphologies and exhibit median OS of 125 months. Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age.CONCLUSION: TERT promoter mutations were specific to gliomas.  We defined, based on TERTp-mut and IDH mutation status, four prognostic groups: (1) TERTp-mut and IDH-mut associated with 1p19q codeletion, overall survival (OS)>17 years; (2) TERTp-wt and IDH-mut, associated with TP53 mutation, OS=97.5 months; (3) TERTp-wt and IDH-wt, with no specific association, OS=31.6 months; (4) TERTp-mut and IDH-wt, associated with EGFR amplification, OS=15.4 months.  Mutations lead to TERT upregulation and are associated with aggressive clinical behavior in glioblastomas.  In the subset of 116 IDH-mutated lower-grade gliomas lacking 1p/19q codeletion, 19 TERT promoter-mutated tumors exhibited longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.027) and OS (P=0.004).  The mean age at diagnosis was lowest (37 years) among patients who had gliomas with only IDH mutations and was highest (59 years) among patients who had gliomas with only TERT mutations. The molecular groups were independently associated with overall survival among patients with grade II or III gliomas but not among patients with grade IV gliomas. Mutations were detected in gliomas, but not in meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, cavernomas, intracranial metastases, normal brain tissues, or peripheral blood of glioma patients. Patients with TERT promoter mutations had lower survival rates, even after adjusting for other known or potential risk factors, and the incidence of mutation was correlated with patient age.	yes
140	52f77f892059c6d71c00002c	Is stop codon bypass possible?	In 1999, proof-of-concept for treating these disorders was obtained in a mouse model of muscular dystrophy, when administration of aminoglycosides restored protein translation by inducing the ribosome to bypass a PTC. Aminoglycosides can bypass nonsense mutations and are the prototypic agents for translational bypass therapy (TBT). Expression of retroviral replication enzymes (Pol) requires a controlled translational recoding event to bypass the stop codon at the end of gag. This recoding event occurs either by direct suppression of termination via the insertion of an amino acid at the stop codon (readthrough) or by alteration of the mRNA reading frame (frameshift). Recent studies on translation termination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have not only enabled the identification of the key components of the termination machinery, but have also revealed several regulatory mechanisms that might enable the controlled synthesis of C-terminally extended polypeptides via stop-codon readthrough.  The effects of all possible single-base mutations in the codons flanking the stop indicated that 3' contexts of the form CAR-YYA confer leakiness and that the 3' context permits read through of UAA and UGA stop codons as well as UAG. As a first step to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which ribosomes bypass leaky stop codons in vivo, we have devised a system in which readthrough is coupled to the transient expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) in tobacco protoplasts. 	yes

BNP and fT3 are independently associated with exercise capacity in severely compromised HF patients. fter adjustment for known confounders, NT-pro-BNP was significantly associated with fT3 and low-T3 syndrome. fT3 (HR 0.58, 95%CI 0.34-0.98) and low-T3 syndrome (HR 3.0, 95%CI 1.4-6.3) were predictive for mortality after adjustment for NT-pro-BNP levels and other cardiovascular prognostic variables. fT3 and low-T3 syndrome are significantly related to NT-pro-BNP in patients with cardiovascular disease, but are predictors of mortality independently of NT-pro-BNP and other known cardiovascular risk parameters.

172	52cb9b9b03868f1b0600002d	Are there any urine biomarkers for bladder cancer diagnosis?	CONCLUSIONS: Several gene-based urinary biomarkers have demonstrated promise in initial studies, which now need to be rigorously validated in the clinical setting for them to be translated into clinically useful tests in diagnosis, surveillance or risk-stratification of bladder cancer  Novel promising markers are in various stages of clinical testing, and a panel of biomarkers may serve in the future as a feasible alternative to urine cytology and cystoscopy for the screening, detection, and follow-up of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. RESULTS: Seven of the 8 urine biomarkers were increased in subjects with bladder cancer relative to those without bladder cancer. The 7 biomarkers were assessed in a new model, which had an AUROC of 0.88 (95% CI 0.84-0.93), and 74% sensitivity and 90% specificity. The study provides further evidence that the reported panel of diagnostic biomarkers can reliably achieve the noninvasive detection of bladder cancer with higher sensitivity than currently available urine based assays. The urinary concentrations of 14 biomarkers (IL-8, MMP-9, MMP-10, SDC1, CCL18, PAI-1, CD44, VEGF, ANG, CA9, A1AT, OPN, PTX3, and APOE) were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Diagnostic performance of each biomarker and multivariate models were compared using receiver operating characteristic curves and the chi-square test. An 8-biomarker model achieved the most accurate BCa diagnosis (sensitivity 92%, specificity 97%), but a combination of 3 of the 8 biomarkers (IL-8, VEGF, and APOE) was also highly accurate (sensitivity 90%, specificity 97%). For comparison, the commercial BTA-Trak ELISA test achieved a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 83%, and voided urine cytology detected only 33% of BCa cases in the same cohort. These data show that a multivariate urine-based assay can markedly improve the accuracy of non-invasive BCa detection : Histopathological grading of papillary urothelial tumors (PUTs) of the urinary bladder is subjective and poorly reproducible. We investigated the relationship between the expression of frequently deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as their target genes (ZEB1/ZEB2) and bladder cancer histopathological grade in an attempt to find a miRNA that might allow more reliable grading of PUTs. The Mcm5 immunoassay is a non-invasive test for identifying patients with urothelial cancers with similar accuracy to the FDA-approved NMP22 ELISA Test Kit. The combination of Mcm5 plus NMP22 improves the detection of UCC and identifies 95% of clinically significant disease. Trials of a commercially developed Mcm5 assay suitable for an end-user laboratory alongside NMP22 are required to assess their potential clinical utility in improving diagnostic and surveillance care pathways. HYAL-1 and HAS1 expression predicted BCa metastasis, and HYAL-1 expression also predicted disease-specific survival. Furthermore, the combined HAS2-HYAL-1 biomarker detected BCa and significantly predicted its recurrence. Cancer biomarkers are the backbone for the implementation of individualized approaches to bladder cancer (BCa).  Through genomic and proteomic profiling of urine, we have identified a panel of biomarkers associated with the presence of BCa. In this study, we evaluated the utility of three of these biomarkers, interleukin 8 (IL-8), Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and Syndecan in the diagnosis of BCa through urinalysis. METHODS: Voided urines from 127 subjects, cancer subjects (n = 64), non-cancer subjects (n = 63) were analyzed. The protein concentrations of IL-8, MMP-9, and Syndecan were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). . There was an association between differences in individual biomarkers and differences in protein levels over time, particularly in control patients. Collectively, our findings identify caveats intrinsic to the common practice of protein standardization in biomarker discovery studies conducted on urine, particularly in patients with hematuria	yes
211	550899c92e93f0133a000003	Is K-63 linked protein ubiquitination related to proteasomal degradation?	In contrast to K48-linked polyubiquitin chains, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains function in nonproteasomal biological processes. Modification of proteins by the addition of lysine (K)-63-linked polyubiquitin (polyUb) chains is suggested to play important roles in a variety of cellular events, including DNA repair, signal transduction, and receptor endocytosis.  Ubiquitination is best known for its role in targeting proteins for degradation by the proteasome, but evidence of the nonproteolytic functions of ubiquitin is also rapidly accumulating. One example of the regulatory, rather than proteolytic, function of ubiquitin is provided by study of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) proteins, which function as ubiquitin ligases to synthesize lysine 63 (K(63))-linked polyubiquitin chains to mediate protein kinase activation through a proteasome-independent mechanism. Some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF3, have recently been shown to have a positive role in the canonical pathway that activates nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) through IkappaB kinase beta (IKKbeta), but a negative role in the noncanonical pathway that activates NF-kappaB through IKKalpha. These opposing roles of TRAF proteins may be linked to their ability to synthesize distinct forms of polyubiquitin chains. Indeed, the TRAF2-interacting protein RIP can mediate IKK activation when it is modified by K(63) polyubiquitin chains, but is targeted to degradation by the proteasome when it is K(48)-polyubiquitinted by the NF-kappaB inhibitor A20. Thus, ubiquitin chains are dynamic switches that can influence signaling outputs in dramatically different ways. Importantly, although Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains appear to trigger proteasomal degradation, the presence of Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains suggests that ubiquitination of IP(3)Rs may have physiological consequences beyond signaling for degradation. Chains of ubiquitin linked via lysine 48 (K48) are associated with protein degradation while chains linked via lysine 63 (K63) are associated with intracellular signaling. Lys(48)-linked chains target proteins for proteasomal degradation, and Lys(63)-linked chains function in signal transduction, endocytosis and DNA repair Remarkably, the attached Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains are homogeneous and are segregated to separate IP(3)R subunits, and Lys-48-linked ubiquitin chains, but not Lys-63-linked chains, are required for IP(3)R degradation Activated inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are modified by homogeneous Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked ubiquitin chains, but only Lys-48-linked chains are required for degradation.	no

High-dose glucocorticoid therapy in the management of seizures in neonatal incontinentia pigmenti Incontinentia pigmenti is an X-linked dominant disorder resulting from a mutation of IKBKG. This disorder has a classic dermatologic presentation, but neurologic involvement, with seizures and cortical infarction, can arise shortly after birth Some children with incontinentia pigmenti exhibit encephalopathic features with severe seizures and disturbed consciousness, from the neonatal through the early infantile period Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare X-linked dominant neurocutaneous disorder affecting ectodermal tissue: skin, eyes, central nervous system, hair, nails, and teeth. It is usually lethal for males in utero. The involved gene is NEMO, an essential component of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Skin lesions are highly diagnostic, occurring in neonates, with a particular distribution on Blaschko lines. The severity of the disease is related to ocular and neurological impairment.

Rad9 interacts with Aft1 to facilitate genome surveillance in fragile genomic sites under non-DNA damage-inducing conditions in S. cerevisiae. Here we show that Rad9 checkpoint protein, known to mediate the damage signal from upstream to downstream essential kinases, interacts with Aft1 transcription factor in the budding yeast. Aft1 regulates iron homeostasis and is also involved in genome integrity having additional iron-independent functions. Using genome-wide expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation approaches, we found Rad9 to be recruited to 16% of the yeast genes, often related to cellular growth and metabolism, while affecting the transcription of ∼2% of the coding genome in the absence of exogenously induced DNA damage. Importantly, Rad9 is recruited to fragile genomic regions (transcriptionally active, GC rich, centromeres, meiotic recombination hotspots and retrotransposons) non-randomly and in an Aft1-dependent manner. Further analyses revealed substantial genome-wide parallels between Rad9 binding patterns to the genome and major activating histone marks, such as H3K36me, H3K79me and H3K4me. Thus, our findings suggest that Rad9 functions together with Aft1 on DNA damage-prone chromatin to facilitate genome surveillance, thereby ensuring rapid and effective response to possible DNA damage events.

245	54d796f93706e8952800001e	Has protein citrullination been implicated in rheumatoid arthritis?	: Citrullination has become a hot topic within recent years due to its involvement in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis and fibrosis.  Current literature suggests that increased levels of citrullinated proteins are found in several if not all inflammatory diseases.  Antibodies directed against citrullinated proteins and peptides (ACPAs) are the most specific serological markers available for diagnosing RA.  Citrullination of proteins is well described in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and hypercitrullination of proteins may be related to inflammation in general.  Some ACPA are remarkably effective as diagnostics in autoimmune disorders, most notably rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Several ACPA can be observed before other clinical RA manifestations are apparent.  Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein/peptide autoantibodies (ACPAs).  Anti-citrullinated peptides as autoantigens in rheumatoid arthritis-relevance to treatment. The implications of citrullination affecting integrin binding in disease open up a new area of study and might have implications for the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis. In this paper, we will review the three of the main classes of PTMs already associated with RA: citrullination, carbamylation, and oxidation. Citrullinated collagen II (CII) is a well-known autoantigen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).  Among the RA-associated autoantibodies, especially anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) have been studied intensively in the last decade. Protein citrullination is a posttranslational modification that has attracted increased attention, especially for its involvement in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Identification of citrullinated cellular fibronectin in synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Cellular fibronectin (cFn) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and we previously demonstrated the presence of citrullinated cFn in rheumatoid synovial tissues.  . In rheumatoid arthritis, PAD4 and protein citrullination are increased in inflamed joints, and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) form against citrullinated antigens are formed. 	yes
248	52bf1aa503868f1b06000006	Is it safe to use Abatacept during pregnancy?	These patients were exposed to rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) or abatacept (fusion protein CTLA4Ig) during the first trimester of their pregnancies. No significant adverse effects or complications were observed during the pregnancies, and all three patients delivered healthy newborns.  Despite these favorable outcomes, the use of these two biological agents must follow international recommendations. Their use is not currently allowed during pregnancy except in cases where the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus PREGNANCY:                          Azathioprine, chloroquine, cyclosporin A, prednisolone, sulfasalazine, tacrolimus and cyclophosphamide (only after the second trimester) may be administered during pregnancy. Biologics should be avoided unless there is a treatment need in cases of uncontrolled disease activity. As such, it is recommended that abatacept, rituximab and tocilizumab be withheld prior to pregnancy; however, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and anakinra may be continued until conception.  Case reports on abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy are not conclusive. The very limited experience with abatacept, tocilizumab or anakinra in pregnancy allows no statement as to their compatibility with pregnancy. At present use of biological agents throughout pregnancy cannot be recommended. Drugs recommended to be stopped before pregnancy include methotrexate and leflunomide, plus the biologics: anti-TNF agents, rituximab and abatacept. Whereas methotrexate, leflunomide, abatacept and rituximab must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors and bisphosphonates can be continued until conception. Pregnancy experience with abatacept and rituximab is still too limited to prove their safety for the developing fetus. They must be withdrawn before a planned pregnancy. Prophylactic withdrawal of drugs before pregnancy is mandatory for abatacept, rituximab, LEF and MMF. 	no

AM and Dron affected TR expression in the RA similarly by decreasing TRalpha 1 and beta 1 expression by about 50% In the LVW, AM and Dron decreased TRbeta 1 and, interestingly, AM increased TRalpha 1. n the apex, AM also increased TRalpha 2. Both in treated and untreated mice, TRalpha2 mRNA had the highest density in mouse heart, whereas TRbeta2 mRNA had the lowest density. Amiodarone dose-dependently downregulated the levels of TRalpha1 and beta1 mRNA in comparison to the control. amiodarone subtype selectively downregulates the TR mRNA levels in mouse myocardium in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot analysis revealed no change in the expression of the ThR protein. Amiodarone and T3, respectively, downregulated T3R alpha 1, T3R beta 1, T3R beta 2 (p < 0.05), but did not affect the levels of T3R alpha 2. Amiodarone and T3, added together, upregulated T3R alpha 2 and T3R beta 1 (p < 0.05) as compared to amiodarone or T3 alone.	yes
275	52efc041c8da89891000001b	Does thyroid hormone affect cardiac remodeling?	"The aim of this brief paper is to highlight new developments in understanding the cardioprotective role of thyroid hormone in reverting regulatory networks involved in adverse cardiac remodeling. Thyroid hormone receptor α1 (TRα1) is shown to be critical for the maturation of cardiomyocytes and for the cellular response to stress. TRα1 is altered during post ischemic cardiac remodeling but the physiological significance of this response is not fully understood.  AMI induces downregulation of thyroid hormone signaling and pharmacological inhibition of TRα1 further depresses post-ischemic cardiac function. These findings reveal crucial roles for Dio3 in heart function and remodeling, which may have pathophysiologic implications for human restrictive cardiomyopathy. TH administration after AMI prevented tissue hypothyroidism and resulted in decreased beta-MHC expression, increased wall thickening and normalized wallstress, while stretch-induced p38 MAPK activation was increased. We conclude that diabetes exacerbates post-ischemic cardiac remodeling and that tissue hypothyroidism may be involved in this response. Thyroid hormone can favorably remodel the diabetic myocardium after acute myocardial infarction. It has been previously shown that regulators of physiological growth such as thyroid hormone (TH) can favorably remodel the post ischaemic myocardium. Acute myocardial infarction in diabetic rats results in TH receptor down-regulation with important physiological consequences. TH treatment prevents this response and improves cardiac hemodynamics. TH affects cardiac remodeling by limiting reperfusion injury, and, at later states, by inducing distinct changes in cardiac chamber geometry in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, administration of TH can convert pathologic to physiologic hypertrophy. These effects are the result of favorable cellular remodeling. Thyroid hormone (TH) is critical in cardiac cell differentiation (regulating contractile proteins and cell geometry) and this effect could be potentially exploited therapeutically in reversing the process of de-differentiation which underlies postischemic cardiac remodeling.  TH treatment partially reverses cardiac dysfunction in rats with old myocardial infarction by favorably changing cardiac chamber geometry and expression of myosin isoforms. Thyroid hormone, unlike current treatments, appears to be a paradigm of therapeutic intervention which aims at restoring cardiac geometry and may prove new effective treatment for heart failure. Changes in thyroid hormone (TH)-TH receptors (TRs) axis occur in the course of post-infarction cardiac remodeling and seem to contribute to cardiac fetal phenotype. TH can ""rebuild"" the post-infarcted heart by preventing the fetal-like pattern of contractile proteins expression, normalizing wall tension, and optimizing cardiac chamber geometry.  TH, apart from its ""classical"" actions on cardiac contractility and heart rhythm, appears to regulate various intracellular signaling pathways related to stress responses and cardiac remodelling. More importantly, experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that TH can limit ischaemic injury, attenuate cardiac remodeling and improve cardiac hemodynamics.  Thyroid hormone attenuates cardiac remodeling and improves hemodynamics early after acute myocardial infarction in rats. Thyroid hormone administration early after infarction attenuates cardiac remodeling and significantly improves myocardial performance. It has previously been shown that thyroid hormone can reverse cardiac remodeling in failing hearts by reducing myocardial wall stress due to the unique changes induced in cardiac myocyte shape. "	yes
279	551910fa622b19434500000b	Is PLK2 involved in alpha-synuclein phosphorylation in Parkinson disease?	An increase in α-synuclein levels due to gene duplications/triplications or impaired degradation is sufficient to trigger its aggregation and cause familial Parkinson disease  Here, we report that Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2), an enzyme up-regulated in synucleinopathy-diseased brains, interacts with, phosphorylates and enhances α-synuclein autophagic degradation in a kinase activity-dependent manner. Polo-like kinase 2 regulates selective autophagic α-synuclein clearance and suppresses its toxicity in vivo Collectively, our findings demonstrate that PLK2 is a previously undescribed regulator of α-synuclein turnover and that modulating its kinase activity could be a viable target for the treatment of synucleinopathies.  α-Synuclein increased PLK2 levels and GSK-3β activity and increased the levels of phosphorylated α-Synuclein and Tau Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) phosphorylates alpha-synuclein at serine 129 in central nervous system Several neurological diseases, including Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, are characterized by the accumulation of alpha-synuclein phosphorylated at Ser-129 (p-Ser-129) Here we submit evidence that polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2, also known as serum-inducible kinase or SNK) is a principle contributor to alpha-synuclein phosphorylation at Ser-129 in neurons.

283	5162f5b6298dcd4e5100004c	Do DNA double-strand breaks play a causal role in carcinogenesis?	The DNA non-homologous end-joining repair gene XRCC6/Ku70 plays an important role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by both exogenous and endogenous DNA-damaging agents. Defects in overall DSB repair capacity can lead to genomic instability and carcinogenesis. The tumor suppressor breast cancer susceptibility protein 1 (BRCA1) protects our cells from genomic instability in part by facilitating the efficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). BRCA1 promotes the error-free repair of DSBs through homologous recombination and is also implicated in the regulation of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair fidelity. The increased frequency of DSB mutagenesis and MMEJ repair in the absence of BRCA1 suggests a potential mechanism for carcinogenesis. Comet assay under neutral conditions allows detection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which has consequence to genome instability and carcinogenesis. Loss of p15/Ink4b accompanies tumorigenesis triggered by complex DNA double-strand breaks. Although DSBs are potentially carcinogenic, it is not clear whether complex DSBs that are refractory to repair are more potently tumorigenic compared with simple breaks that can be rapidly repaired, correctly or incorrectly, by mammalian cells. Zinc chromate induces chromosome instability and DNA double strand breaks in human lung cells. Our study shows that zinc chromate induced concentration-dependent increases in cytotoxicity, chromosome damage and DNA double strand breaks in human lung cells. Foci formation of P53-binding protein 1 in thyroid tumors: activation of genomic instability during thyroid carcinogenesis. Nitric oxide and acid induce double-strand DNA breaks in Barrett's esophagus carcinogenesis via distinct mechanisms. DNA double-strand break repair capacity and risk of breast cancer. A tumorigenic role of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) has been suggested by our finding of a significant association between increased breast cancer risk and a cooperative effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in NHEJ genes. Carcinogen-induced DNA double strand break repair in sporadic breast cancer. Induction of DNA double strand breaks and alterations in the repair of these breaks is implicated in breast carcinogenesis. Prior studies have demonstrated that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from breast cancer patients exhibit increased numbers of DNA strand breaks after exposure to ionizing radiation, but these studies did not specifically measure DNA double strand breaks and it is not known whether chemical carcinogens produce similar effects. Abnormal DNA end-joining activity in human head and neck cancer. In human cells, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are repaired primarily by the DNA end-joining (EJ) process and thus, abnormal DNA EJ activities lead to an accumulation of mutations and/or aneuploidy, resulting in genetic instability of cells. Since genetic instability is the hallmark of cancer cells, we studied the DNA EJ activities of normal, non-malignant immortalized and malignant human epithelial cells to investigate the association between DNA EJ and carcinogenesis. Homologous recombination repair plays an important role in DSB repair and impairment of this repair mechanism may lead to loss of genomic integrity, which is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Recent research has shown that the tumor suppressor genes p53 and BRCA1 and -2 are involved in the proper control of homologous recombination, suggesting a role of this type of repair in human cancer. In order to study the role of DNA damage processing in the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), we assessed the ability of six keratinocyte cell lines from a multistage-tumor progression model to repair three types of DNA damage: pyrimidine dimers, oxidative DNA lesions and DNA double strand breaks (DSB). However, an acquired deficiency in repairing DNA double strand breaks can be one mechanism promoting progression towards malignancy, possibly through impairing chromosomal stability. Recent findings demonstrate that accelerated carcinogenesis following liver regeneration is associated with chronic inflammation-induced double-strand DNA breaks in cells, which escaped apoptosis due to proliferative stress. Although DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis may relate to arsenite-induced damage and carcinogenesis, the mechanism of action remains obscure.	yes

309	570908e3cf1c325851000012	Is EZH2 associated with prostate cancer?	The role of EZH2 in the regulation of the activity of matrix metalloproteinases in prostate cancer cells EZH2 plays an active role in this process by repressing the expression of TIMP2 and TIMP3 in prostate cancer cells The TIMP genes are derepressed by knockdown of EZH2 expression in human prostate cancer cells but repressed by overexpression of EZH2 in benign human prostate epithelial cells. Overexpression of EZH2 confers an invasive phenotype on benign prostate epithelial cells EZH2 knockdown markedly reduces the proteolytic activity of MMP-9, thereby decreasing the invasive activity of prostate cancer cells he transcriptional repression of the TIMP genes by EZH2 may be a major mechanism to shift the MMPs/TIMPs balance in favor of MMP activity and thus to promote ECM degradation and subsequent invasion of prostate cancer cells. Expression levels of the novel tumor and metastasis suppressor Raf-1 kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) have been shown to correlate negatively with those of EZH2 in breast and prostate cell lines as well as in clinical cancer tissues Polycomb protein EZH2 regulates tumor invasion via the transcriptional repression of the metastasis suppressor RKIP in breast and prostate cancer Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which encodes the histone methyltransferase component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), is overexpressed widely in breast and prostate cancers and epigenetically silences tumor suppressor genes However, the roles and underlying mechanisms of EZH2 in prostate cancer stem cells (PCSCs) remain unknown c-Myc, EZH2 and p27 were defined to modulate the behavior of prostate cancer with pro-tumoral or anti-tumoral effects and had ability in predicting prostate cancer progression, but the research of their co-expression value of prognosis is rarely Composite index of c-Myc, EZH2, and p27 can be valued as powerful prognosis parameter for intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients after the surgery, and postoperative adjuvant therapy can be adopted accordingly. EZH2, an epigenetic driver of prostate cancer. The histone methyltransferase EZH2 has been in the limelight of the field of cancer epigenetics for a decade now since it was first discovered to exhibit an elevated expression in metastatic prostate cancer a comprehensive overview of EZH2 in the context of prostate cancer EZH2 dependent H3K27me3 is involved in epigenetic silencing of ID4 in prostate cancer ChIP data on prostate cancer tissue specimens and cell lines suggested EZH2 occupancy and H3K27Me3 marks on the ID4 promoter Collectively, our data indicate a PRC2 dependent mechanism in ID4 promoter silencing in prostate cancer through recruitment of EZH2 and a corresponding increase in H3K27Me3. Increased EZH2 but decreased ID4 expression in prostate cancer strongly supports this model. The histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has recently attracted considerable attention because of its dysregulation in prostate cancer (PCa) and its important function in PCa development.  Autoregulatory feedback loop of EZH2/miR-200c/E2F3 as a driving force for prostate cancer development Amounts of both EZH2 messenger RNA and EZH2 protein are increased in metastatic prostate cancer; in addition, clinically localized prostate cancers that express higher concentrations of EZH2 show a poorer prognosis. The data show that amplification of the EZH2 gene is rare in early prostate cancer, whereas a fraction of late-stage tumors contains the gene amplification leading to the overexpression of the gene, thus indicating the importance of EZH2 in the progression of prostate cancer. EZH2 expression in prostate cancer correlates with progression to hormone-refractory and metastatic disease, but it is unknown whether EZH2 plays a specific role in the acquisition of an advanced prostate cancer phenotype. Although prior studies in prostate cancer have revealed a number of possible mechanisms of EZH2 upregulation, these changes cannot account for the overexpression EZH2 in many primary prostate cancers, nor in most cases of high grade PIN. As a result, five EZH2 peptides recognized by IgG (EZH2 120-128, EZH2 165-174, EZH2 569-577, EZH2 665-674, and EZH2 699-708) were frequently detected in the plasma of prostate cancer patients. Thus, dysregulated expression of EZH2 may be involved in the progression of prostate cancer, as well as being a marker that distinguishes indolent prostate cancer from those at risk of lethal progression. These results link two major pathways in prostate cancer by providing two additional and complementary Myc-regulated mechanisms by which EZH2 upregulation occurs and is enforced during prostatic carcinogenesis. EZH2 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and invasiveness. EZH2 promotes proliferation and invasiveness of prostate cancer cells. The Polycomb Group protein EZH2 is implicated in prostate cancer progression. The polycomb group protein EZH2 is involved in progression of prostate cancer. Mutation screen and association study of EZH2 as a susceptibility gene for aggressive prostate cancer. Expression changes in EZH2, but not in BMI-1, SIRT1, DNMT1 or DNMT3B are associated with DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer. The gene for polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is amplified in late-stage prostate cancer. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a kind of transcriptional repressor, is reportedly over-expressed in metastatic prostate cancer. IgGs reactive to three EZH2 peptides (EZH2-243 to -252, EZH2-291 to -299, and EZH2-735 to -;742) were detected in the plasma of almost half of prostate cancer patients. Amounts of both EZH2 messenger RNA and EZH2 protein are increased in metastatic prostate cancer; in addition, clinically localized prostate cancers that express higher concentrations of EZH2 show a poorer prognosis. Overexpression of EZH2 has been associated with the invasion and progression of malignant cancers, especially with the progression of prostate cancer. Antigens overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer are appropriate targets in anti-cancer immunotherapy, and one candidate is the polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2).  Cytoplasmic EZH2 is expressed at low levels in benign prostate epithelial cells and over-expressed in prostate cancer cells. Cytoplasmic EZH2 expression levels correlate with nuclear EZH2 expression in prostate cancer samples. DNMT1 or DNMT3B are associated with DNA methylation changes in prostate cancer. EZH2:ECAD status was statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer recurrence in a training set of 103 patients (relative risk [RR] = 2.52, a positive EZH2:ECAD status) was the biomarker combination that was most strongly associated with the recurrence of prostate cancer. PcG proteins EZH2, BMI1, and RING1 are associated with adverse pathologic features and clinical PSA recurrence of prostate cancer. Immunohistochemistry results were evaluated in conjunction with clinical parameters associated with prostate cancer progression, Elevation of the chromatin repression factor enhancer of zeste homolog (EZH2) is associated with progression and poor prognosis in several human cancers including prostate cancer. Various proteins (α2-integrin, α6-integrin, CD117, CD133, EZH2, OCT3/4) are associated with a prostate cancer stem cell phenotype in cell lines and xenografts. Increased expression of EZH2 has been associated previously with invasive growth and aggressive clinical behavior in prostate and breast cancer, EZH2:ECAD status was statistically significantly associated with prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy and may be useful in defining a cohort of high-risk patients. Immunohistochemistry results were evaluated in conjunction with clinical parameters associated with prostate cancer progression, including tumor stage, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. EZH2 expression is associated with high proliferation rate and aggressive tumor subgroups in cutaneous melanoma and cancers of the endometrium, prostate, and breast. Moderate or strong expression of EZH2 coupled with at most moderate expression of ECAD (i.e., a positive EZH2:ECAD status) was the biomarker combination that was most strongly associated with the recurrence of prostate cancer. Cytoplasmic EZH2 expression levels correlate with nuclear EZH2 expression in prostate cancer samples.	yes
320	5314d0e4dae131f84700000e	Can administration of the thyrotropin releasing hormone reduce fatigue in cancer patients?	TRH administration was associated with significant improvement (p < 0.05) in fatigue levels as measured by the Visual Analog Scale-Energy (VAS-E), was associated with significant (p < 0.05) improvement in sleep disturbances and improved quality of life.  This decrease in CRP level with TRH administration was associated with improvement in energy levels as measured by the VAS-E.  In the present pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of TRH as a treatment for CF. TRH administration was associated with significant improvement in fatigue level as measured by the VAS-E, the fatigue and vigor subscales of the POMS, and the fatigue subscale of FACIT-F (p < 0.05).  TRH administration was efficacious, safe, and tolerable in the treatment of CF with a positive impact on quality of life. These results provide a crucial impetus for pursuing TRH therapeutics to treat CF. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone can relieve cancer-related fatigue: hypothesis and preliminary observations. Global assessment using both subjective and objective parameters showed that TRH exerted clear anti-fatigue effects in four of the six TRH treatments.  These initial findings support the proposal that TRH can ameliorate cancer-related fatigue.	yes

348	56d34fbcf22319765a000009	Can chronological age be predicted by measuring telomere length?	Human somatic cells gradually lose telomeric repeats with age. This study investigated if one could use a correlation between telomere length and age, to predict the age of an individual from their DNA. Therefore, telomere length measurement by real-time quantitative PCR cannot be used to predict age of a person, due to the presence of large inter-individual variations in telomere lengths. ur results provide the first clear and unambiguous evidence of a relationship between telomere length and mortality in the wild, and substantiate the prediction that telomere length and shortening rate can act as an indicator of biological age further to chronological age when exploring life history questions in natural conditions.	no
356	530cf4fe960c95ad0c000003	Could Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT) cause sudden cardiac death?	Here we refine our approach, and apply it to novel variants found in 2266 patients across two large cohorts with inherited sudden death syndromes, namely catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) or Brugada syndrome (BrS). Calsequestrin-associated catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT2) can cause sudden death in young individuals in response to stress.  Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic cardiac disorder characterized by life-threatening arrhythmias induced by physical or emotional stress, in the absence structural heart abnormalities. The arrhythmias may cause syncope or degenerate into cardiac arrest and sudden death which usually occurs during childhood In many cases the cause of death can be elucidated by medico-legal autopsy, however, a significant number of these cases remain unexplained despite a detailed postmortem investigation and are labeled as sudden unexplained death (SUD). Post-mortem genetic testing, so called molecular autopsy, revealed that primary arrhythmogenic disorders including long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) may account for a certain number of these cases. We report a family with repeat events of sudden cardiac death and recurrent ventricular fibrillation in a teenage girl, where autopsy data and clinical investigations were inconclusive. The diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) was established only following finding a gene mutation in the cardiac ryano Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a devastating inherited disorder characterized by episodic syncope and/or sudden cardiac arrest during exercise or acute emotion in individuals without structural cardiac abnormalities. Although rare, CPVT is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young individuals.  In conclusion, patients with CASQ2-associated CPVT should be recommended to receive ICDs to prevent sudden death when medical therapy is not effective.  Cardiac channelopathies associated with structurally normal hearts such as long QT syndrome (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and Brugada syndrome (BrS) yield no evidence to be found at autopsy, leaving coroners, medical examiners, and forensic pathologists only to speculate that a lethal arrhythmia might lie at the heart of a sudden unexplained death (SUD). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare adrenergically mediated arrhythmogenic disorder classically induced by exercise or emotional stress and found in structurally normal hearts. It is an important cause of cardiac syncope and sudden death in childhood. We also compare CPVT to other notable cardiomyopathic and channelopathic causes of sudden death in youth including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, long QT syndrome, short QT syndrome, and Brugada syndrome. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an inherited arrhythmogenic disease that can cause sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation (VF). Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an arrhythmogenic disease that manifests as syncope or sudden death during high adrenergic tone in the absence of structural heart defects. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a cardiac channelopathy characterized by altered intracellular calcium handling resulting in ventricular arrhythmias and high risk of cardiac sudden death in young cases with normal structural hearts Early detection of CPVT is crucial because opportune medical intervention prevents sudden cardiac death.   If untreated, CPVT is highly lethal, as approximately 30% of affected individuals experience at least one cardiac arrest and up to 80% one or more syncopal spells. Sudden death may be the first manifestation of the disease.  Hereditary non-structural diseases such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), long QT, and the Brugada syndrome as well as structural disease such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) cause a significant percentage of sudden cardiac deaths in the young Patients with CPVT present with exercise-induced syncope and sudden cardiac death but normal resting electrocardiograms. Although structural cardiovascular abnormalities explain most cases of sudden cardiac death in young people, the cause of death remains unexplained after autopsy in 10% to 30% of cases. Potentially lethal ion channel disorders (channelopathies) such as the long QT syndromes (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT), and the Brugada syndrome (BrS) may account for at least one-third of these unexplained cases.  Based on these data, we propose that CPVT is a combined neurocardiac disorder in which leaky RyR2 channels in the brain cause epilepsy, and the same leaky channels in the heart cause exercise-induced sudden cardiac death. The inherited arrhythmogenic diseases associated with the transmembranous ionic channels, anchoring proteins or intracellular calcium regulating proteins are thought to be responsible for sudden cardiac death in infants, children, and young adults who have structurally normal hearts. Recent genetic analyses have identified congenital diseases such as the long-QT syndrome (LQTS), the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (JLNS), the Brugada syndrome (BrS), the short-QT syndrome (SQTS), the arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy type 2 (ARVC2), and the catecholamine-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) /familial polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (FPVT).  At least some cases of sudden, unexplained death in young individuals may be ascribed to CPVT	yes

359	55425615ed966d112c000003	Are genes symmetrically distributed between leading and lagging DNA strand in bacteria?	Genomic DNA is used as the template for both replication and transcription, whose machineries may collide and result in mutagenesis, among other damages. Because head-on collisions are more deleterious than codirectional collisions, genes should be preferentially encoded on the leading strand to avoid head-on collisions, as is observed in most bacterial genomes examined. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication. This presumably avoids the potentially detrimental head-on collisions that occur between the replication and transcription machineries when genes are encoded on the lagging strand. The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand genes of some functional categories such as ribosome have higher preferences to be on the leading strands genes of some functional categories such as transcription factor have higher preferences on the lagging strands essential genes are more preferentially situated at the leading strand than at the lagging strand remarkable strand-bias of the distribution of essential genes Head-on encounters between the replication and transcription machineries on the lagging DNA strand can lead to replication fork arrest and genomic instability. To avoid head-on encounters, most genes, especially essential and highly transcribed genes, are encoded on the leading strand such that transcription and replication are co-directional. Replication-associated purine asymmetry may contribute to strand-biased gene distribution. strand-biased gene distribution (SGD) SGD correlates not only with polC, but also with purine asymmetry (PAS) In bacteria, most genes are on the leading strand of replication, a phenomenon attributed to collisions between the DNA and RNA polymerases. genes whose expression is important for fitness are selected to the leading strand because this reduces the duration of these interruptions Among prokaryotic genomes, the distribution of genes on the leading and lagging strands of the replication fork is known to be biased.  We show that the evidence they provided is invalid and that the existence of lagging strand encoded genes is explainable by a balance between deleterious mutations that bring genes from the leading to the lagging strand and purifying selection purging such mutants. Based on those experimentally determined for 10 bacteria, we find that essential genes are more preferentially situated at the leading strand than at the lagging strand, for all the 10 genomes studied, confirming previous findings based on either smaller datasets or putatively assigned ones by homology search. The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand, and the percentage of such genes has a large variation across different bacteria. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication. This paradox could be explained by assuming that the stronger mutation pressure and selection after inversion preferentially eliminate genes transferred from the leading to the lagging DNA strand. We have shown that the relative number of translocations which have switched positions of genes from the leading to the lagging DNA strand is lower than the number of translocations which have transferred genes from the lagging strand to the leading strand of prokaryotic genomes. Most genes in bacteria are encoded on the leading strand of replication The majority of bacterial genes are located on the leading strand, and the percentage of such genes has a large variation across different bacteria We have shown that the relative number of translocations which have switched positions of genes from the leading to the lagging DNA strand is lower than the number of translocations which have transferred genes from the lagging strand to the leading strand of prokaryotic genomes Using Monte Carlo methods, we have simulated, under experimentally determined directional mutation pressure, the divergence rate and the elimination rate of genes depending on their location in respect to the leading/lagging DNA strands in the asymmetric prokaryotic genome	no
372	511a1e12df1ebcce7d000009	Is it possible to determine the proteome of a formalin fixed and paraffin embedded  (FFPE) tissue?	"ver the last few years, advances in methodology have made it possible to recover peptides from FFPE tissues that yield a reasonable representation of the proteins recovered from identical fresh or frozen specimens. Thus, laser capture microdissection of FFPE tissue coupled with downstream proteomic analysis is a valid approach Qualitative proteome profiling of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is advancing the field of clinical proteomics. Recent improvements in proteomics technologies, from the 2D gel analysis of intact proteins to the ""shotgun"" quantification of peptides and the use of isobaric tags for absolute and relative quantification (iTRAQ) method, have made the analysis of FFPE tissues possible. The ability to investigate the proteome of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues can be considered a major recent achievement in the field of clinical proteomics. The label-free approach enables the quantitative measurement of radiation-induced alterations in FFPE tissue and facilitates retrospective biomarker identification using clinical archives. Proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissue using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We report that differentially expressed proteins can be identified among FFPE tissue specimens originating from individuals with different pancreatic histologic findings. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) proteome analysis using gel-free and gel-based proteomics. This study will facilitate the development of future proteomic analysis of FFPE tissue and provide a tool for the validation in archival samples of biomarkers of exposure, prognosis and disease. The CAAR method presented here complements previously described antigen-retrieval protocols and is an important step in being able to fully analyze the proteome of archived FFPE tissue. Proteome, phosphoproteome, and N-glycoproteome are quantitatively preserved in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue and analyzable by high-resolution mass spectrometry. It has only recently been shown that proteins in FFPE tissues can be identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomics but analysis of post-translational modifications is thought to be difficult or impossible Results from the FFPE-FASP procedure do not indicate any discernible changes due to storage time, hematoxylin staining or laser capture microdissection. Thus, FFPE biobank material can be analyzed by quantitative proteomics at the level of proteins and post-translational modifications. A novel tissue microdissection technique has been developed and combined with a method to extract soluble peptides directly from FFPE tissue for mass spectral analysis of prostate cancer (PCa) and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). Hundreds of proteins from PCa and BPH tissue were identified, espite using tissue blocks stored for as many as 28 years, high confidence and comparative proteome analysis between the leiomyomas and the sarcoma is achieved. These findings demonstrate that formalin fixation, paraffin processing, and LCM do not negatively impact protein quality and quantity as determined by MS and that FFPE samples are amenable to global proteomic analysis. Protein extraction of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue enables robust proteomic profiles by mass spectrometry."	yes

Therapeutic immunization of mSOD1 mice with a myelin-derived peptide led to CP activation, and was followed by the accumulation of immunoregulatory cells, including IL-10-producing monocyte-derived macrophages and Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, and elevation of the neurotrophic factors IGF-1 and GDNF in the diseased spinal cord parenchyma Immunization with a Myelin-Derived Antigen Activates the Brain's Choroid Plexus for Recruitment of Immunoregulatory Cells to the CNS and Attenuates Disease Progression in a Mouse Model of ALS. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rapidly progressing fatal neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the selective death of motor neurons (MN) in the spinal cord, and is associated with local neuroinflammation. T-cell deficiency increases neuronal loss, while boosting T cell levels reduces it. As disease accelerates, a shift occurs from beneficial immune responses (involving M2 microglia and regulatory T-cells) to deleterious immune responses (involving M1 microglia and Th1 cells). In this review, we underscore the importance of immune-mediated mechanisms in the pathogenesis of ALS and discuss the alterations and distinct phenotypes of immune cells at the different stages of disease.  Immunological disturbances have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Chemokines are involved in the recruitment of immune cells. The immune system has been found to be involved with positive and negative effects in the nervous system of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. In general, T cells, B cells, NK cells, mast cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, microglia, antibodies, complement and cytokines participate in limiting damage. Immunological disturbances have been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Chemokines are involved in the recruitment of immune cells. We propose the following mechanism for the effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) administered intrathecally in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): MSCs increase infiltration of peripheral immune cells into CNS and skew the infiltrated immune cells toward regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg ) and Th2 lymphocytes. Immune cell infiltration to the brain&apos;s territory was considered for decades to reflect a pathological process in which immune cells attack the central nervous system (CNS); such a process is observed in the inflammatory autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis (MS).	yes
398	56d8ba1851531f7e33000005	Is the gene SLC6A2 associated with orthostatic intolerance?	Orthostatic intolerance is a debilitating syndrome characterized by tachycardia on assumption of upright posture. The norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) has been implicated in a genetic form of the disorder.  Thus attenuated baroreflex function and reduced sympathetic outflow may contribute to the orthostatic intolerance of severe NET deficiency. A mutation in the human norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) associated with orthostatic intolerance disrupts surface expression of mutant and wild-type transporters.  Recently, our laboratory reported a polymorphism in the human NET (hNET) gene A457P in an individual with the autonomic disorder orthostatic intolerance (OI).  Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human NET (hNET) gene that influence transporter function can contribute to disease, such as the nonfunctional transporter, A457P, identified in orthostatic intolerance.  Orthostatic intolerance is not necessarily related to a specific mutation (Ala457Pro) in the human norepinephrine transporter gene. We propose that chromatin-modifying events associated with SLC6A2 gene suppression may constitute a mechanism of POTS. The goal of the present study was to further characterize the role and regulation of the SLC6A2 gene in POTS. In the absence of altered SLC6A2 gene sequence or promoter methylation, this reduced expression was directly correlated with chromatin modifications.  We propose that chromatin-modifying events associated with SLC6A2 gene suppression may constitute a mechanism of POTS. A coding mutation in the norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) sequence has been reported in 1 family kindred only. The goal of the present study was to further characterize the role and regulation of the SLC6A2 gene in POTS.	yes

A linear error model for the raw intensity data and Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) based alignment are combined utilizing a Bayesian score function, which is then globally optimized over all possible genomic locations using an efficient branch-and-bound approach. The algorithm has been implemented in soft- and hardware [field-programmable gate array (FPGA)] to achieve real-time performance. we have designed and built a high-performance FPGA-accelerated version of BLASTP, Mercury BLASTP. In this paper, we describe the architecture of the portions of the application that are accelerated in the FPGA, and we also describe the integration of these FPGA-accelerated portions with the existing BLASTP software. We have implemented Mercury BLASTP on a commodity workstation with two Xilinx Virtex-II 6000 FPGAs. This paper shows how reconfigurable architectures can be used to derive an efficient fine-grained parallelization of the dynamic programming calculation. We describe how this technique leads to significant runtime savings for HMM database scanning on a standard off-the-shelf field-programmable gate array (FPGA). We have constructed a linear systolic array to perform pairwise sequence distance computations using dynamic programming. This results in an implementation with significant runtime savings on a standard FPGA. in this paper, we focused on accelerating the Smith-Waterman algorithm by modifying the computationally repeated portion of the algorithm by FPGA hardware custom instructions. We present a reconfigurable systolic architecture that can be applied for the efficient treatment of several dynamic programming methods for resolving well-known problems, such as global and local sequence alignment, approximate string matching and longest common subsequence. The dynamicity of the reconfigurability was found to be useful for practical applications in the construction of sequence alignments. A VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language) version of this new architecture was implemented on an APEX FPGA (Field programmable gate array). This results in an implementation of ClustalW with significant runtime savings on a standard off-the-shelf FPGA. The accelerator implements a version of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for nucleotide sequence alignment. Sequence lengths are constrained only by available memory; the product of sequence lengths in the current implementation can be up to 2(22). The machine is implemented as two NuBus boards connected to a Mac IIf/x, using a mixture of TTL and FPGA technology clocked at 10 MHz.	yes

New uses of thalidomide. Thalidomide is an anti-angiogenesis agent that currently is being evaluated in the treatment of various types of cancer. The comeback of thalidomide to the legitimate status of a marketed drug came in 1998 when it received FDA approval for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) Thalidomide is considered the drug of choice for the treatment of ENL, but for other conditions, it is recommended only when resistance to the currently available form of therapy is encountered Thalidomide is an anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic drug currently used for the treatment of several diseases, including erythema nodosum leprosum, which occurs in patients with lepromatous leprosy Thalidomide, once banned, has returned to the center of controversy with the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) announcement that thalidomide will be placed on the market for the treatment of erythema nodosum leprosum, a severe dermatological complication of Hansen's disease.  In 1998, FDA approved the marketing of thalidomide (Thalomid, Celgene).  In 1998 the US Food and Drug Administration approved thalidomide exclusively for the treatment of ENL, and strict conditions were stipulated for its use in order to prevent teratogenic adverse effects. BACKGROUND: The use of thalidomide during the 1950s resulted in teratogenic effects in thousands of infants. Although thalidomide is currently approved for the treatment of a complication of leprosy, it is commercially available to treat other diseases through a controlled distribution system.

457	58a6b98860087bc10a000028	Is SUMOylation a post-translational modification in eukaryotes?	SUMOylation, the conjugation of target proteins with SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier), is a type of post-translational modification in eukaryotes and involves the sequential action of activation (E1), conjugation (E2) and ligation (E3) enzymes.  Plants have evolved to cope with changing environmental conditions. One way plants achieve this is through post-translational modification of target proteins by ubiquitination and SUMOylation. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification essential in most eukaryotes that regulates stability, localization, activity, or interaction of a multitude of proteins. SUMOylation, the covalent attachment of a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins to lysines in target substrates, is an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes.  Post-translational modification by SUMO is a highly conserved pathway in eukaryotes that plays very important regulatory roles in many cellular processes.  SUMOylation is an essential post-translational modification that regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression. Although the SUMOylation pathway has been identified and investigated in many eukaryotes, the mechanisms of SUMOylation in regulating the functions of various substrates are still poorly understood.  SUMOylation is a relevant protein post-translational modification in eukaryotes. SUMOylation is a reversible post-translational modification essential for genome stability. Many SUMOylated lysines have previously been reported to be ubiquitinated, acetylated or methylated, thus indicating cross-talk between SUMO and other post-translational modifications. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification shown to play a role in diverse biological processes. Besides phosphorylation or ubiquitylation, for which many examples of modulation by pathogens exist, a post-translational modification called SUMOylation was recently shown to be targeted by pathogenic bacteria. cruzi SUMOylated proteins are similarly modified, indicating conserved functions for protein SUMOylation in this early divergent eukaryote. PML is a potent tumor suppressor and proapoptotic factor and is functionally regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, sumoylation, and ubiquitination. SUMOylation is an essential post-translational modification that regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression. SUMOylation in Giardia lamblia: A Conserved Post-Translational Modification in One of the Earliest Divergent Eukaryotes SUMOylation, the covalent attachment of a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins to lysines in target substrates, is an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes SUMOylation is a relevant protein post-translational modification in eukaryotes Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are one facet of this proteasomal regulation, with over 400 known phosphorylation sites, over 500 ubiquitination sites and 83 internal lysine acetylation sites, as well as multiple sites for caspase cleavage, glycosylation (such as O-GlcNAc modification), methylation, nitrosylation, oxidation, and SUMOylation SUMOylation is an important post-translational modification, and Akt SUMOylation was found to regulate cell proliferation, tumorigenesis and cell cycle, but the molecular mechanism of Akt SUMOylation is less well known SUMOylation is a form of post-translational modification where small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMO) are covalently attached to target proteins to regulate their properties One distinctive feature in acute proteotoxic stresses, such as heat shock (HS), is rapid post-translational modification of proteins by SUMOs (small ubiquitin-like modifier proteins; SUMOylation) Post-translational modification by the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) proteins, a process termed SUMOylation, is involved in many fundamental cellular processes SUMOylation is an important post-translational modification that is involved in many key biological processes Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) undergo post-translational modification by SUMO in in vitro assays but the SUMOylation of full-length mGluRs in mammalian cells has not been reported SUMOylation is a relevant protein post-translational modification in eukaryotes.  However, the effects of pathogenic bacteria on SUMOylation, an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotic cells, remain largely unknown.  A novel post-translational modification of nucleolin, SUMOylation at Lys-294, mediates arsenite-induced cell death by regulating gadd45� mRNA stability. Drosophila Bicoid is a substrate of sumoylation and its activator function is subject to inhibition by this post-translational modification. Here, we demonstrate that SUMOylation of RelB might be one of these post-translational modifications rendering the function of the NF-�B transcription factor RelB.  In the last decade, SUMOylation has emerged as an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes. SUMOylation, the conjugation of target proteins with SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier), is a type of post-translational modification in eukaryotes and involves the sequential action of activation (E1), conjugation (E2) and ligation (E3) enzymes. SUMOylation, the covalent attachment of a member of the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family of proteins to lysines in target substrates, is an essential post-translational modification in eukaryotes. One way plants achieve this is through post-translational modification of target proteins by ubiquitination and SUMOylation. The small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) pathway in eukaryotes is an essential post-translational modification required for a variety of cellular processes, development and organelle biogenesis. Post-translational modification by SUMO is a highly conserved pathway in eukaryotes that plays very important regulatory roles in many cellular processes. Many SUMOylated lysines have previously been reported to be ubiquitinated, acetylated or methylated, thus indicating cross-talk between SUMO and other post-translational modifications. We identified 70 phosphorylation and four acetylation events in proximity to SUMOylation sites, and we provide evidence for acetylation-dependent SUMOylation of endogenous histone H3. SUMOylation regulates target proteins involved in all nuclear processes including transcription, DNA repair, chromatin remodeling, precursor-mRNA splicing and ribosome assembly. SUMOylation is a reversible post-translational modification essential for genome stability. Using high-resolution MS, we have studied global SUMOylation in human cells in a site-specific manner, identifying a total of>4,300 SUMOylation sites in>1,600 proteins. We quantitatively studied SUMOylation dynamics in response to SUMO protease inhibition, proteasome inhibition and heat shock. Many SUMOylated lysines have previously been reported to be ubiquitinated, acetylated or methylated, thus indicating cross-talk between SUMO and other post-translational modifications. We identified 70 phosphorylation and four acetylation events in proximity to SUMOylation sites, and we provide evidence for acetylation-dependent SUMOylation of endogenous histone H3. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification shown to play a role in diverse biological processes. Here, we demonstrate that sumoylation is essential for proper heterochromatin function in Drosophila through modification of SU(VAR)3-7. Indeed, SU(VAR)3-7 is sumoylated at lysine K839; this modification is required for localization of SU(VAR)3-7 at pericentric heterochromatin, chromosome 4, and telomeres. Sumoylation is a post-translational modification shown to play a role in diverse biological processes. Here, we demonstrate that sumoylation is essential for proper heterochromatin function in Drosophila through modification of SU(VAR)3-7. Our results suggest a new level of regulation of Sall activity in vivo during animal development through post-translational modification by sumoylation. BACKGROUND: Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier protein (SUMO) is a key regulator of nuclear functions but little is known regarding the role of the post-translational modification sumoylation outside of the nucleus, particularly in the Central Nervous System (CNS).METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report that the expression levels of SUMO-modified substrates as well as the components of the sumoylation machinery are temporally and spatially regulated in the developing rat brain. SUMOylation in Giardia lamblia: A Conserved Post-Translational Modification in One of the Earliest Divergent Eukaryotes. Identification of a novel post-translational modification in Plasmodium falciparum: protein sumoylation in different cellular compartments. More recently, Akt has been identified as a substrate for many different post-translational modifications, including not only phosphorylation of other residues, but also acetylation, glycosylation, oxidation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation.	yes

482	58a5add260087bc10a000022	Does NADPH oxidase 5 require any subunit for function?	Nox5 forms a functional oligomer mediated by self-association of its dehydrogenase domain.  While Nox1-4 require regulatory subunits, including p22phox, Nox5 activity does not depend on any subunits.   Thus, Nox5 forms a catalytically active oligomer in the membrane that is mediated by its dehydrogenase domain.  Coexpression of specific Nox catalytic subunits (Nox1, Nox2, Nox3, Nox4, or Nox5) along with their corresponding regulatory subunits (NOXO1/NOXA1 for Nox1; p47phox/p67phox/Rac for Nox2; NOXO1 for Nox3; no subunits for Nox4 or Nox5) resulted in marked production of reactive oxygen. 	no
489	58cd6d9702b8c6095300003c	Do normal cells express the protein TERT?	Since telomerase has been recognized as a relevant factor distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells, it has become a very promising target for anti-cancer therapy Telomerase plays a pivotal role in cellular immortality and tumorigenesis. Its activity is normally not detectable in most somatic cells while it is reactivated in the vast majority of cancer cells. Therefore, inhibition of telomerase has been viewed as a promising anticancer approach due to its specificity for cancer cells. Telomerase activity is found in 85%-90% of all human cancers but not in their adjacent normal cells. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is an essential component in the telomerase complex that plays an important role in telomerase activity. elomerase activation is considered to be a critical step in carcinogenesis and its activity correlates closely with human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression. Since only tumor cells that express telomerase activity would activate this promoter, the hTERT proximal promoter allows for preferential expression of viral genes in tumor cells, leading to selective viral replication	no
496	58bdc76102b8c60953000013	Does the hERG gene code for a protein which is part of a sodium channel?	 The human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG 1a) potassium channel is critical for cardiac repolarization Human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channels conduct delayed rectifier K(+) current.  The KvLQT1 and minK genes code the slowly activating, delayed rectifier (Iks) potassium channel, the HERG gene code the rapidly activating, delayed rectifier (Ikr) potassium channel of the heart, while the SCN5A gene codes a cardiac sodium channel. The molecular basis of inherited disorders caused by a mutation in either the gene coding for a particular potassium channel called HERG-or another gene, SCN5A, which codes for the sodium channel and disruption of which results in a loss of inactivation of the Na+ current. The aim of this study was to test whether a recently reported polymorphism in the HERG gene coding for the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel has influence on myocardial repolarization. Mutations in KvLQT1, minK and HERG genes affects repolarising, rectifier potassium currents, while SCN5A mutations cause delayed inactivation and reopening of the cardiac sodium channel, which initiates the depolarisation of cardiac cells. A human genetic defect associated with 'long Q-T syndrome', an abnormality of cardiac rhythm involving the repolarization of the action potential, was recently found to lie in the HERG gene, which codes for a potassium channel. Therefore, matrine and oxymatrine may have the potential to cure LQT2 as a potassium channel activator by promoting hERG channel activation and increasing hERG channel expression. The human delta1261 mutation of the HERG potassium channel results in a truncated protein that contains a subunit interaction domain and decreases the channel expression. HERG (human eag-related gene) encodes an inward-rectifier potassium channel formed by the assembly of four subunits. The human ether-?-go-go-related gene (HERG) encodes the pore-forming subunit of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium channel in the heart. The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) encodes the rapidly activating, delayed rectifier potassium channel (IKr) important for cardiac repolarization. Role of glycosylation in cell surface expression and stability of HERG potassium channels. The human ERG protein (HERG or Kv 11.1) encoded by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (herg) is the pore-forming subunit of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) responsible for action potential (AP) repolarization Human ether-a-go-go related gene (herg) encoding HERG K(+) channel has been demonstrated in many previous studies with its association to cell cycle progression and growth in tumor cells A human genetic defect associated with 'long Q-T syndrome', an abnormality of cardiac rhythm involving the repolarization of the action potential, was recently found to lie in the HERG gene, which codes for a potassium channel.  Drug-induced long QT syndrome: hERG K+ channel block and disruption of protein trafficking by fluoxetine and norfluoxetine. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test whether a recently reported polymorphism in the HERG gene coding for the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel has influence on myocardial repolarization.  The aim of this study was to test whether the K897T polymorphism of the KCNH2 (HERG) gene coding for the rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ channel influences cardiac repolarization assessed by principal component analysis (PCA) of T-wave morphology.  The KvLQT1 and minK genes code the slowly activating, delayed rectifier (Iks) potassium channel, the HERG gene code the rapidly activating, delayed rectifier (Ikr) potassium channel of the heart, while the SCN5A gene codes a cardiac sodium channel. All code for subunits of sodium or potassium channels: two a subunits of the potassium channels (QVLQT1 for LQT1, HERG for LQT2), the a subunit of the sodium channel INa (SCN5A for LQT3), and two regulatory subunits of potassium channels (KCNE1 for LQT5 regulating the KvLQT1 channel and MiRP1 regulating HERG). The corresponding genes code for potassium channels KVLQT1 (LQT1) and HERG (LQT2) and the sodium channel SCN5A (LQT3). The molecular basis of inherited disorders caused by a mutation in either the gene coding for a particular potassium channel called HERG-or another gene, SCN5A, which codes for the sodium channel and disruption of which results in a loss of inactivation of the Na+ current. There may also be correlation between the strength of binding of the medicinal substance to the potassium channel coded by the HERG gene and prolongation of the QT interval. We demonstrate that the mRNA 3'UTR of ppk29 affects neuronal firing rates and associated heat-induced seizures by acting as a natural antisense transcript (NAT) that regulates the neuronal mRNA levels of seizure (sei), the Drosophila homolog of the human Ether-à-go-go Related Gene (hERG) potassium channel. Mutations in KvLQT1, minK and HERG genes affects repolarising, rectifier potassium currents, while SCN5A mutations cause delayed inactivation and reopening of the cardiac sodium channel, which initiates the depolarisation of cardiac cells. Among the congenital forms, particularly interest is focused on the potassium channel coded by the HERG gene located on chromosome 7 and with a key role in the normal electric cardiac activity. By employing heterologous expression and making comparisons to cells expressing wild-type human-ether-a-go-go-related protein (HERG), a potassium channel that contributes to I(Kr) current in ventricular cardiomyocytes, we demonstrate activation of an elevated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response by the mutant I593R HERG potassium channel implicated in long QT syndrome type 2. Correction of defective protein trafficking of a mutant HERG potassium channel in human long QT syndrome.

508	5896d3e278275d0c4a000012	Is siltuximab effective for Castleman disease?	Siltuximab: a targeted therapy for idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease. The recent approvals in North America, Europe and Brazil of siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6, for iMCD now provide a safe and effective therapy that targets a key aspect of pathogenesis. In the first ever randomized, placebo-controlled trial in iMCD, siltuximab significantly reduced disease burden and symptoms in a large portion (34%) of patients. Despite recent significant advances in our understanding of this disease and the increasing therapeutic experience with rituximab, tocilizumab and siltuximab, there are still difficult questions concerning its aetiology, prognosis and optimal treatment. Emerging treatments in Castleman disease - a critical appraisal of siltuximab.  Siltuximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody to IL-6, has thus emerged as a promising treatment option in a disease lacking efficacious therapy. Here, we review the findings of recent studies evaluating single-agent siltuximab treatment in CD, including the first-ever randomized clinical trial in this disease. Although much more work is needed to establish a standardized treatment approach, siltuximab appears to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with newly diagnosed and previously treated CD. FDA approval: siltuximab for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman disease. On April 22, 2014, the FDA granted full approval to siltuximab (SYLVANT for injection; Janssen Biotech, Inc.), a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody to IL6, for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative.  Currently, there are more effective therapeutic alternatives in multicentric Castleman disease: treatment with monotherapy of rituximab or in combination therapy with immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide or lenalidomide, treatment with anti-IL-6 (siltuximab) or against its receptor (tocilizumab).  Currently, there are more effective therapeutic alternatives in multicentric Castleman disease: treatment with monotherapy of rituximab or in combination therapy with immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide or lenalidomide, treatment with anti-IL-6 (siltuximab) or against its receptor (tocilizumab).

PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of siltuximab, an anti-interleukin-6 chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), multiple myeloma, or Castleman disease.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In an open-label, dose-finding, 7 cohort, phase I study, patients with NHL, multiple myeloma, or symptomatic Castleman disease received siltuximab 3, 6, 9, or 12 mg/kg weekly, every 2 weeks, or every 3 weeks. Dose selection of siltuximab for multicentric Castleman's disease. Here, modeling and simulation of the pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship between siltuximab and CRP were used to support dose selection for multicentric Castleman's disease (CD).METHODS: PK/PD modeling was applied to explore the relationship between siltuximab PK and CRP suppression following intravenous siltuximab infusion in 47 patients with B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 17), multiple myeloma (n = 13), or CD (n = 17). Currently, there are more effective therapeutic alternatives in multicentric Castleman disease: treatment with monotherapy of rituximab or in combination therapy with immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide or lenalidomide, treatment with anti-IL-6 (siltuximab) or against its receptor (tocilizumab) Three (6%) of 53 patients had serious adverse events judged reasonably related to siltuximab (lower respiratory tract infection, anaphylactic reaction, sepsis).Siltuximab plus best supportive care was superior to best supportive care alone for patients with symptomatic multicentric Castlemans disease and well tolerated with prolonged exposure Siltuximab, an anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, has demonstrated durable tumor and symptomatic responses in a multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled study of MCD.This preplanned safety analysis was conducted to evaluate the long-term safety of siltuximab treatment among 19 patients with MCD who had stable disease or better and were enrolled in a phase-1 study and subsequent ongoing, open-label, phase-2 extension study Analysis of Inflammatory and Anemia-Related Biomarkers in a Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study of Siltuximab (Anti-IL6 Monoclonal Antibody) in Patients With Multicentric Castleman Disease Siltuximab (IL6 antibody) is approved for the treatment of multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) Siltuximab for multicentric Castleman disease FDA approval: siltuximab for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman disease On April 22, 2014, the FDA granted full approval to siltuximab (SYLVANT for injection; Janssen Biotech, Inc.), a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody to IL6, for the treatment of patients with multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) negative Siltuximab for multicentric Castleman's disease: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Clinical benefit response (CBR; composite of hemoglobin, fatigue, anorexia, fever/night sweats, weight, largest lymph node size) was also evaluated in Castleman disease.Sixty-seven patients received a median of 16 siltuximab doses for a median of 8.5 (maximum 60.5) months; 29 were treated 1 year or longer. The recent approvals in North America, Europe and Brazil of siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody against IL-6, for iMCD now provide a safe and effective therapy that targets a key aspect of pathogenesis. Although much more work is needed to establish a standardized treatment approach, siltuximab appears to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with newly diagnosed and previously treated CD. No dose-limiting toxicity was reported, and only three patients had grade 3 or higher adverse events after a median exposure of 331 days (range, 1 to 1,148 days).These interim results strongly suggest that siltuximab is an effective treatment with favorable safety for the management of CD. Siltuximab is a new anti-IL-6, chimeric monoclonal antibody with potential therapeutic benefit in patients with CD.METHODS: We report interim results from an open-label, dose-finding, seven-cohort, phase I study in which patients with symptomatic, multicentric or unresectable, unicentric CD received siltuximab at 1-, 2-, or 3-week intervals.

529	58d90f228acda3452900000f	Is diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) a phospholipid of the mitochondrial membranes?	A unique organelle for studying membrane biochemistry is the mitochondrion whose functionality depends on a coordinated supply of proteins and lipids. Mitochondria are capable of synthesizing several lipids autonomously such as phosphatidylglycerol, cardiolipin and in part phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid and CDP-diacylglycerol. A small decrease of diphosphatidylglycerol also occurred in the hepatoma mitochondria inner membrane.  Diphosphatidylglycerol was confined to the mitochondrial fraction, where it represented about 7% of the total phosphoacylglycerols.  Mitochondrial membranes were isolated from the myocardium of young (4-month-old) and aged (33-month-old) male Long-Evans rats and compared in terms of cholesterol content and phospholipid and fatty acid composition. In aged rats, as compared to young, the major observations include: markedly higher cholesterol content; increased percentage of sphingomyelin and diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin);  The polyglycerophosphatides (typified by diphosphatidylglycerol) were apparently synthesized in situ by intramitochondrial membrane-bound enzymes using CDP-diglycerides as intermediates.  Both the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions contained significant proportions of solvent front phospholipid (SFP) and whereas the mitochondrial SFP displayed the relatively unsaturated fatty acid composition characteristic of diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin), the fatty acids of the microsomal SFP were distinctly more saturated. Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). The enzyme responsible for the conversion of phosphatidylglycerol to diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) in the presence of cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol is firmly associated with mitochondrial membranes and is not extracted with hypotonic or hypertonic media or with nonionic detergents. The mechanism of cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) biosynthesis was examined in mitochondria and outer and inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea pig and rat livers to determine whether this formation from phosphatidylglycerol was absolutely dependent on cytidinediphosphodiglyceride, as previously reported for intact mitochondria. In isolated mitochondrial outer membranes, cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) increased CPT1 activity 4-fold and the Km for carnitine 6-fold. Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin). 90% or more of the phospholipid, cardiolipin was found in the mitochondrial membranes of wild type and petite yeast. Furthermore, the same mechanism for the biosynthesis of cardiolipin was operational in the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. The mechanism of cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) biosynthesis was examined in mitochondria and outer and inner mitochondrial membranes prepared from guinea pig and rat livers to determine whether this formation from phosphatidylglycerol was absolutely dependent on cytidinediphosphodiglyceride, as previously reported for intact mitochondria Cardiolipin (CL) is a key phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes, playing important roles in maintaining the functional integrity and dynamics of mitochondria in animals and yeasts Cardiolipin, the specific phospholipid of mitochondria, is involved in the biogenesis, the dynamics, and the supramolecular organization of mitochondrial membranes Cardiolipin (CL), the signature phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes, is crucial for both mitochondrial function and cellular processes outside of the mitochondria Since it has been recognized that mitochondria are crucial not only for energy metabolism but also for other cellular functions, there has been a growing interest in cardiolipin, the specific phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes Cardiolipin, the main anionic phospholipid in mitochondrial membranes, is expected to be a determinant in this adaptive mechanism since it modulates the activity of most membrane proteins Ten to 15% of microsomal radioactive CDP-diglycerides was transferred to mitochondrial membranes and incorporated into mitochondrial radioactive lipids identified as phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerophosphate, and, when [14C]linoleoyl CDP-diglycerides were used, diphosphatidylglycerol (cardiolipin) Cardiolipin is normally localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane; however, when cardiolipin becomes externalized to the surface of dysregulated mitochondria, it promotes inflammasome activation and stimulates the elimination of damaged or nonfunctional mitochondria by mitophagy In isolated mitochondrial outer membranes, cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) increased CPT1 activity 4-fold and the Km for carnitine 6-fold.  Increasing levels of cardiolipin differentially influence packing of phospholipids found in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Here, we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae subjected to conditions that affect mitochondrial metabolism as a model to determine the possible role of cardiolipin in stress adaptation.  This decline of respiration was attributed to a progressive diminution of the number of mitochondria in copper-treated cells, based on the demonstration of the concomitant decline of (1) cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol) and cytochrome aa3 (cytochrome oxidase), two specific markers of mitochondrial inner membrane, and (2) fumarase activity, a specific marker of mitochondrial matrix space. Diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG) or cardiolipin, a specific component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, represents about 4% of the total lipid content. Experimental results confirmed that the biosynthesis of cardiolipin, from the membrane-bound radioactive phosphatidylglycerol in intact mitochondria isolated from guinea pig and rat liver, was absolutely dependent on CDP-diglycerides and required the addition of divalent cations. We have shown that decrease of cardiolipin in mitochondrial membrane occurs early during ischemia, and only during the irreversible phase of ischemia are phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine broken down. Partial purification of diphosphatidylglycerol synthetase from liver mitochondrial membranes. A small decrease of diphosphatidylglycerol also occurred in the hepatoma mitochondria inner membrane.	yes

Autophagy, a cellular degradation process Autophagy, a form of lysosomal degradation capable of eliminating dysfunctional proteins and organelles, is a cellular process associated with homeostasis. Autophagy, a programmed process in which cell contents are delivered to lysosomes for degradation, appears to have both tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting functions; both stimulation and inhibition of autophagy have been reported to induce cancer cell death, and particular genes and proteins have been associated both positively and negatively with autophagy Autophagy is a lysosome-mediated catabolic process involving the degradation of intracellular contents (e.g., proteins and organelles) as well as invading microbes (e.g., parasites, bacteria and viruses). Autophagy is a cellular process that targets proteins, lipids and organelles to lysosomes for degradation, but it has also been shown to combat infection with various pathogenic bacteria. Autophagy, an intracellular degradation process highly conserved from yeast to humans, is viewed as an important defence mechanism to clear intracellular bacteria. Autophagy has intracellular anti-viral and anti-bacterial functions, and plays a role in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune system responses to viral and bacterial infections. documented abundant autophagy within VZV-infected cells throughout the infectious cycle but also demonstrated that VZV-induced autophagy facilitated VZV glycoprotein biosynthesis and processing.

545	58da270d8acda34529000013	Is edema a symptom of nephrotic syndrome?	Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a common clinical disease with four main clinical manifestations: hypoalbuminemia (<30 g/L), macro-proteinuria (>3.5 g/24 h), edema, and hyperlipidemia.  Nephrotic syndrome is an unusual manifestation of IgA Nephropathy (IgAN). Twelve patients with IgAN with steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome were evaluated and followed up. All patients presented with generalized edema.  The clinical features of sudden onset of generalized edema, initial heavy proteinuria and initial severe hypoalbuminemia might help identify the subset of patients, especially in low grade IgAN. Most patients presented within 3 months duration (61.4%) and the most common symptom was puffiness of face (98.45%) followed by pedal edema (91%).  We analyzed medical records of 290 patients with diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome as defined by International Study of Kidney Disease in Children (ISKDC), between January 1987 and December 2000, at the Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Soura, Srinagar.  He was admitted because of systemic edema and dyspnea on effort Laboratory data revealed renal failure and nephrotic syndrome, whereas there was no symptom of diabetic retinopathy. Nephrotic syndrome: more than just oedema. Oedema is the commonest presenting symptom and sign in nephrotic syndrome.  One of these five clinical syndromes is the nephrotic syndrome, which is characterized by proteinuria > 3.5 g/day accompanied by hypalbuminemia, hyperlipoproteinemia and pronounced edema Tolvaptan therapy for massive edema in a patient with nephrotic syndrome Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by water and sodium retention, which leads to edema The non-osmotic stimulation of arginine vasopressin release from the pituitary gland has been implicated as one of the important factors in abnormal water retention in patients with NS.We present the initial description of a patient with massive edema caused by refractory nephrotic syndrome, which was effectively treated with tolvaptan, a selective oral vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist.Tolvaptan is effective for the treatment of massive edema caused by NS We report a child with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome with diuretic-resistant nephrotic edema treated successfully using acute peritoneal dialysis as a means of UF Albumin and Furosemide Combination for Management of Edema in Nephrotic Syndrome: A Review of Clinical Studies The treatment of edema in patients with nephrotic syndrome is generally managed by dietary sodium restriction and loop diuretics Nine months after introduction of tiopronin, the boy manifested generalized edema, oliguria, and biochemical indices of nephrotic syndrome Blessed were the days when it all made sense and the apparent mechanism for edema formation in nephrotic syndrome was straightforward: the kidneys lost protein in the urine, which lowered the plasma oncotic pressure The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by a combination of pathological lab values and clinical symptoms, i. e. pronounced proteinuria (usually more than 3 - 3,5 g protein/24 h), hypoalbuminemia, edema and hyperlipidemia. The patient was admitted with edema of both legs, and the nephrotic syndrome was discovered, leading to the diagnosis of AA amyloidosis on kidney biopsy. Linear regression to relate measures.Other signs and symptoms of nephrotic syndrome at baseline (serum albumin < 3.5 g/dL, serum total cholesterol > 260 mg/dL or use of a statin, and edema or use of a loop diuretic); progression of chronic kidney disease during follow-up (doubling of baseline serum creatinine level or requirement for dialysis or kidney transplantation). A case of interstitial shadows associated with oral cyclophosphamide therapy in a 32-month-old girl with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, who was admitted to the Nishi-Kobe Medical Center with systemic edema, is reported. Nephrotic syndrome represents a constellation of symptoms including hyperalbuminuria, hypoalbuminemia, edema formation, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, hypercoagulopathy, and increased infection risk.

586	5a43a214966455904c000009	Is DNA methylation correlated with nucleosome occupancy?	"Here I show that CpG islands were associated not only with methylation-free promoters but also with nucleosome-free promoters. Nucleosome-free regions were observed only in promoters containing a CpG island In contrast to the methylation-and nucleosome-free states of CpG-island promoters, exons were densely methylated at CpGs and packaged into nucleosomes. I also found that nucleosomes, DNA methylation, and H3K36me3 marked the exons of transcripts with low, medium, and high gene expression levels, respectively. Human promoters containing a CpG island tend to remain nucleosome-free as well as methylation-free. In contrast, exons demonstrate a high degree of methylation and nucleosome occupancy. Exonic DNA methylation seems to function together with exonic nucleosomes and H3K36me3 for the proper splicing of transcripts with different expression levels. Supporting such an association, recent reports have identified distinct histone methylation patterns, elevated nucleosome occupancy and enriched DNA methylation at exons relative to introns. DNA methylation directly silences genes with non-CpG island promoters and establishes a nucleosome occupied promoter. Using a novel bioinformatics pipeline, we show a striking anti-correlation between nucleosome occupancy and DNA methylation at CTCF regions that is not present at promoters.  Three positions at the splice sites show high CpG abundance and accompany elevated nucleosome occupancy in a leveled GC architecture. The first group has higher nucleosome occupancy on exons than introns, whereas the second group exhibits weak nucleosome marking of exons, suggesting another type of epigenetic marker distinguishes exons from introns when GC content is similar.  DNA methylation can determine nucleosome positioning.  DNA methylation determines nucleosome occupancy in the 5'-CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. he induction of DNA hypomethylation events by genetic (DNMT1/DNMT3B deficient cells) or drug (a DNA demethylating agent) approaches is associated with the eviction of nucleosomes from previously hypermethylated CpG islands of tumor suppressor genes. Using this global approach, we observe the dependency of nucleosome occupancy upon the DNA methylation status. Thus, our results suggest that there is a close association between hypermethylated CpG islands and the presence of nucleosomes, such that each of these epigenetic mechanisms can determine the recruitment of the other. Although global DNA demethylation has been observed after treatment, it is unclear to what extent demethylation induces changes in nucleosome occupancy, a key determinant of gene expression. Our results indicate that only a minority of demethylated promoters are associated with nucleosome remodeling, and these could potentially be the epigenetic drivers causing the loss of tumorigenicity. with repressed genes often being associated with local DNA hypermethylation and gain of nucleosomes at their promoters. Transcription, histone modifications, and DNA methylation alter this ""ground state"" by having distinct effects on both nucleosome positioning and occupancy.  In order to systematically evaluate potential diversities among CGIs and ultimately to illuminate the link between diversity of CGIs and their epigenetic variation, we analyzed the nucleotide-resolution DNA methylation maps (methylomes) of multiple cellular origins. The mostly unmethylated CpG islands have reduced nucleosome occupancy and are enriched in cell type-independent binding sites for CTCF. In contrast, outside of CpG islands most CpGs are methylated, and the average methylation density oscillates so that it is highest in the linker region between nucleosomes. Aberrant acquisition of nucleosomes at enhancer-associated NDRs is associated with hypermethylation and epigenetic silencing marks, and conversely, loss of nucleosomes with demethylation and epigenetic activation. Prominent exceptions to the correlations between methylated CpG density and nucleosome occupancy include CpG islands marked by H3K27me3 and CpG-poor heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3, and these modifications, along with DNA methylation, distinguish the major silencing mechanisms of the human epigenome. Throughout the genome, nucleosome occupancy was correlated with certain histone methylation or acetylation modifications. We further show that the extent of nucleosome depletion at promoters is directly correlated to expression level and can accommodate multiple nucleosomes and provide genome-wide evidence that expressed non-CpG island promoters are nucleosome-depleted."	yes
626	5a6e21b4b750ff445500003a	Are paralog genes co-regulated?	"Co-regulation of paralog genes in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear. In eukaryotes, genes are regulated in part by distal enhancer elements through looping interactions with gene promoters. These looping interactions can be measured by genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments, which revealed self-interacting regions called topologically associating domains (TADs). We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. To test this hypothesis, we integrated paralogy annotations with human gene expression data in diverse tissues, genome-wide enhancer-promoter associations and Hi-C experiments in human, mouse and dog genomes. We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances. Combined, our results indicate that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms and cluster not only in the linear genome but also in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. This enables concerted expression of paralogs over diverse cell-types and indicate evolutionary constraints in functional genome organization. Paralog genes arise from gene duplication events during evolution, which often lead to similar proteins that cooperate in common pathways and in protein complexes. Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs. Analysis of the Drosophila melanogaster testes transcriptome reveals coordinate regulation of paralogous genes.

Co-regulation of paralog genes in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture. Further, interspecific changes in testis bias of expression are generally correlated within the co-regulated pairs and are anti-correlated within the anti-regulated pairs, suggesting coordinated regulation within both types of paralogous gene pairs.. We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances.  MiRNA genes are often subject to co-evolutionary changes together with their target transcripts, which may be reflected by differences between paralog mouse and primate miRNA/mRNA pairs. We characterize the collapse over time through the distribution of runs of reduced paralog pairs in duplicated segments. In addition, we identified 81 co-regulated regions on the human genome (RIDGEs) by using expression data from all cancers. Some RIDGEs (28%) consist of paralog genes while another subset (30%) are specifically dysregulated in tumors but not in normal tissues. We conclude that the similarity of hoxb3a/Hoxa3 regulatory mechanisms reflect the shared descent of both genes from a single ancestral paralog group 3 gene. Conserved co-regulation and promoter sharing of hoxb3a and hoxb4a in zebrafish. By analyzing paralogs of testis-biased genes, we identified ""co-regulated"" paralogous pairs in which both genes are testis biased, ""anti-regulated"" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other downregulated in testes, and ""neutral"" pairs in which one paralog is testis biased and the other constitutively expressed."	yes

36	5502abd1e9bde69634000008	Is Calcium/Calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) involved in cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure?	In human hypertrophy, both CaMKII and PKA functionally regulate RyR2 and may induce SR Ca(2+) leak. In the transition from hypertrophy to HF, the diastolic Ca(2+) leak increases and disturbed Ca(2+) cycling occurs. This is associated with an increase in CaMKII- but not PKA-dependent RyR2 phosphorylation. CaMKII inhibition may thus reflect a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction. Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is an enzyme with important regulatory functions in the heart and brain, and its chronic activation can be pathological. CaMKII activation is seen in heart failure, and can directly induce pathological changes in ion channels, Ca(2+) handling and gene transcription. In the recent years, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was suggested to be associated with cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure but also with arrhythmias both in animal models as well as in the human heart. Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has emerged as a central mediator of cardiac stress responses which may serve several critical roles in the regulation of cardiac rhythm, cardiac contractility and growth. Sustained and excessive activation of CaMKII during cardiac disease has, however, been linked to arrhythmias, and maladaptive cardiac remodeling, eventually leading to heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death.  Overexpression of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in transgenic mice results in heart failure and arrhythmias. From recent studies, it appears evident that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a central role in the arrhythmogenic processes in heart failure by sensing intracellular Ca(2+) and redox stress, affecting individual ion channels and thereby leading to electrical instability in the heart.  CaMKII activation is proarrhythmic in heart failure where myocardium is stretched. The Ca-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) seems to be involved in the development of heart failure and arrhythmias and may therefore be a promising target for the development of antiarrhythmic therapies. Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is up-regulated in heart failure and has been shown to cause I(Na) gating changes that mimic those induced by a point mutation in humans that is associated with combined long QT and Brugada syndromes. CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of Na(V)1.5 at multiple sites (including Thr-594 and Ser-516) appears to be required to evoke loss-of-function changes in gating that could contribute to acquired Brugada syndrome-like effects in heart failure. Because CaMKII expression and activity are increased in cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure, and during arrhythmias both in animal models as well as in the human heart a clinical significance of CaMKII is implied. The multifunctional Ca(2+)- and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is now recognized to play a central role in pathological events in the cardiovascular system. CaMKII has diverse downstream targets that promote vascular disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias, so improved understanding of CaMKII signaling has the potential to lead to new therapies for cardiovascular disease. In our opinion, the multifunctional Ca and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) has emerged as a molecule to watch, in part because a solid body of accumulated data essentially satisfy Koch's postulates, showing that the CaMKII pathway is a core mechanism for promoting myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure. Multiple groups have now confirmed the following: (1) that CaMKII activity is increased in hypertrophied and failing myocardium from animal models and patients; (2) CaMKII overexpression causes myocardial hypertrophy and HF and (3) CaMKII inhibition (by drugs, inhibitory peptides and gene deletion) improves myocardial hypertrophy and HF  In contrast, inhibiting the CaMKII pathway appears to reduce arrhythmias and improve myocardial responses to pathological stimuli.  In this review, we discuss the important role of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the regulation of RyR2-mediated Ca(2+) release. In particular, we examine how pathological activation of CaMKII can lead to an increased risk of sudden arrhythmic death. Finally, we discuss how reduction of CaMKII-mediated RyR2 hyperactivity might reduce the risk of arrhythmias and may serve as a rationale for future pharmacotherapeutic approaches. Transgenic (TG) Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) δ(C) mice develop systolic heart failure (HF). CaMKII regulates intracellular Ca(2+) handling proteins as well as sarcolemmal Na(+) channels. We hypothesized that CaMKII also contributes to diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias via augmentation of the late Na(+) current (late I(Na)) in early HF (8-week-old TG mice). Thus, late I(Na) inhibition appears to be a promising option for diastolic dysfunction and arrhythmias in HF where CaMKII is found to be increased. We tested the hypothesis that increased RyR2 phosphorylation by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is both necessary and sufficient to promote lethal ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: our results suggest that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylation of RyR2 Ca(2+) release channels at S2814 plays an important role in arrhythmogenesis and sudden cardiac death in mice with heart failure. Excessive activation of calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) causes arrhythmias and heart failure, but the cellular mechanisms for CaMKII-targeted proteins causing disordered cell membrane excitability and myocardial dysfunction remain uncertain. Transgenic (TG) Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)delta(C) mice have heart failure and isoproterenol (ISO)-inducible arrhythmias. We hypothesized that CaMKII contributes to arrhythmias and underlying cellular events and that inhibition of CaMKII reduces cardiac arrhythmogenesis in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that CaMKII contributes to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in TG CaMKIIdelta(C) mice having heart failure and suggest the increased SR Ca leak as an important mechanism. Moreover, CaMKII inhibition reduces cardiac arrhythmias in vitro and in vivo and may therefore indicate a potential role for future antiarrhythmic therapies warranting further studies. Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) can phosphorylate RyR2 and modulate its activity. This phosphorylation positively modulates cardiac inotropic function but in extreme situations such as heart failure, elevated CaMKII activity can adversely increase Ca2+ release from the SR and lead to arrhythmogenesis.  Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) is a multifunctional serine/threonine kinase expressed abundantly in the heart. CaMKII targets numerous proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and excitability, and its activation may simultaneously contribute to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Under stress conditions, excessive CaMKII activity promotes heart failure and arrhythmias, in part through actions at Ca(2+) homeostatic proteins. Ca-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) was recently shown to alter Na(+) channel gating and recapitulate a human Na(+) channel genetic mutation that causes an unusual combined arrhythmogenic phenotype in patients: simultaneous long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome. CaMKII is upregulated in heart failure where arrhythmias are common, and CaMKII inhibition can reduce arrhythmias. Thus, CaMKII-dependent channel modulation may contribute to acquired arrhythmic disease.  In heart failure (HF), Ca(2+)/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) expression is increased. Altered Na(+) channel gating is linked to and may promote ventricular tachyarrhythmias (VTs) in HF. Calmodulin regulates Na(+) channel gating, in part perhaps via CaMKII. Thus, CaMKII-dependent regulation of Na(+) channel function may contribute to arrhythmogenesis in HF. Recent findings that CaMKII expression in the heart changes during hypertrophy, heart failure, myocardial ischemia, and infarction suggest that CaMKII may be a viable therapeutic target for patients suffering from common forms of heart disease.  Overexpression of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in transgenic mice results in heart failure and arrhythmias. Transgenic (TG) Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)delta(C) mice have heart failure and isoproterenol (ISO)-inducible arrhythmias. BACKGROUND: Transgenic (TG) Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)delta(C) mice have heart failure and isoproterenol (ISO)-inducible arrhythmias. CaMKII targets numerous proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and excitability, and its activation may simultaneously contribute to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II contributes to cardiac arrhythmogenesis in heart failure. From recent studies, it appears evident that Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) plays a central role in the arrhythmogenic processes in heart failure by sensing intracellular Ca(2+) and redox stress, affecting individual ion channels and thereby leading to electrical instability in the heart. Ryanodine receptor phosphorylation, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. CaMKII targets numerous proteins involved in excitation-contraction coupling and excitability, and its activation may simultaneously contribute to heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias The Ca-calmodulin dependent kinase II (CaMKII) seems to be involved in the development of heart failure and arrhythmias and may therefore be a promising target for the development of antiarrhythmic therapies Calcium-calmodulin kinase II mediates digitalis-induced arrhythmias. Transgenic (TG) Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)delta(C) mice have heart failure and isoproterenol (ISO)-inducible arrhythmias	yes
40	58bbb8ae22d3005309000018	Has whole exome sequencing been performed in Alzheimer patients?	Pilot whole-exome sequencing of a German early-onset Alzheimer's disease cohort reveals a substantial frequency of PSEN2 variants. We performed whole-exome sequencing in early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD) and late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) families followed by functional studies of select variants. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a nonsense mutation in PRNP (NM_000311, c.C478T; p.Q160*; rs80356711) associated with homozygosity for the V allele at position 129 of the protein, further highlighting how very similar genotypes in PRNP result in strikingly different phenotypes. In the search for new genes in Alzheimer's disease, classic linkage-based and candidate-gene-based association studies have been supplanted by exome sequencing, genome-wide sequencing (for mendelian forms of Alzheimer's disease), and genome-wide association studies (for non-mendelian forms).  We performed whole exome sequencing in a Turkish patient clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease from a consanguineous family  Performing exome sequencing in 14 autosomal dominant early-onset Alzheimer disease (ADEOAD) index cases without mutation on known genes (amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin1 (PSEN1) and presenilin2 (PSEN2)), we found that in five patients, the SORL1 gene harbored unknown nonsense (n=1) or missense (n=4) mutations	yes
55	5a70de5199e2c3af26000005	Is scuba diving safe during pregnancy?	Scuba diving is contraindicated. Overall, the women did not conduct enough dives per pregnancy, therefore no significant correlation between diving and fetal abnormalities could be established. These data indicate women are increasingly observing the diving industry recommendation and refraining from diving while pregnant.  Scuba diving also should be avoided throughout pregnancy because the fetus is at an increased risk for decompression sickness during this activity. Scuba diving also should be avoided throughout pregnancy because the fetus is at an increased risk for decompression sickness during this activity. Scuba diving also should be avoided throughout pregnancy because the fetus is at an increased risk for decompression sickness during this activity.  The different international federations and the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society advise against scuba diving for pregnant women or those planning a pregnancy, but no randomized trials or trials provide a solid scientific basis.  Pregnant women are recommended not to dive, because the risk of birth defects seems to be greater among those who do, and there is a serious risk of fetal decompression disease.  The different international federations and the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society advise against scuba diving for pregnant women or those planning a pregnancy, but no randomized trials or trials provide a solid scientific basis.

67	5a70d43b99e2c3af26000003	Does prolactinoma increase osteoporosis risk?	Prolactinoma: A Massive Effect on Bone Mineral Density in a Young Patient. Osteoporosis has been noted to be an issue in postmenopausal women with prolactinomas. This case shows a similar impact on bone health in a young male resulting in low bone mineral density for age based on Z-score. This case report highlights the possible mechanisms for the bone loss in the setting of prolactinoma and the need for assessing bone health in such patients.  Hyperprolactinaemia related to prolactinoma significantly (more than functional hyperprolactiaemia) increases the risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis and bone fractures.  Prolactinomas are the most common type of functional pituitary tumor. Effective hyperprolactinemia treatment is of great importance, due to its potential deleterious effects including infertility, gonadal dysfunction and osteoporosis.  Prolactinomas cause hypogonadism, infertility, osteoporosis, and tumor mass effects, and are the most common type of neuroendocrine tumor. We present a 22-year-old man with multiple osteoporotic fractures associated with prolactinoma despite the use of teriparatide for 18 months. We emphasize and highlight the importance of hyperprolactinemia and fractures caused by high prolactin levels. OBJECTIVE: Patients with prolactinoma seem to be at high risk for osteopenia.  RESULTS: Compared to the matched controls, BMD of patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma significantly decreased.  CONCLUSION: In the premenopausal women, patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma are often accompanied with osteopenia or osteoporosis, and disease duration and hypogonadism are the risk factors of bone loss in prolactinoma. Data on osteoporotic fractures in hyperprolactinemia are limited. An increased prevalence of radiological vertebral fractures was recently observed in women with prolactin (PRL)-secreting adenoma, whereas it is unknown whether this observation may reflect a more general increased risk of fractures in this disease and whether the prevalence of fractures in males is affected by gonadal status. Prolactinoma presenting as chronic anaemia with osteoporosis: a case report. Six years later, he was evaluated and diagnosed with a prolactinoma and resultant osteoporosis. Prolactinoma in old people may present insidiously with chronic anaemia and osteoporosis with or without sexual dysfunction. The relative risk for developing osteoporosis in women with prolactinoma was found to be 4.5, indicating that hyperprolactinemia in women is a major risk factor for osteoporosis.<br> <b>INTRODUCTION</b>: Osteopenia and osteoporosis because of hyperprolactinaemia caused by prolactinoma may be followed by an increased risk of fracture. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis indicated that the bone loss in prolactinomas was significantly correlated to disease duration and hypogonadism.<br><b>CONCLUSION</b>: In the premenopausal women, patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma are often accompanied with osteopenia or osteoporosis, and disease duration and hypogonadism are the risk factors of bone loss in prolactinoma. High serum prolactin levels lead to increase of the risk of osteopenia or/and osteoporosis. Prolactinoma in old people may present insidiously with chronic anaemia and osteoporosis with or without sexual dysfunction.<br><b>CASE PRESENTATION</b>: We describe the case of a 70-year-old Caucasian man who presented with mild anaemia and tiredness. In the premenopausal women, patients with prolactinoma or craniopharyngioma are often accompanied with osteopenia or osteoporosis, and disease duration and hypogonadism are the risk factors of bone loss in prolactinoma. The relative risk for developing osteoporosis in women with prolactinoma was found to be 4.5, indicating that hyperprolactinemia in women is a major risk factor for osteoporosis.

Hyperprolactinaemia related to prolactinoma significantly (more than functional hyperprolactiaemia) increases the risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis and bone fractures. INTRODUCTION Osteopenia and osteoporosis because of hyperprolactinaemia caused by prolactinoma may be followed by an increased risk of fracture. In conclusion, men with prolactinoma have high prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Humans with prolactinoma are at risk for osteoporosis. Osteopenia and osteoporosis because of hyperprolactinaemia caused by prolactinoma may be followed by an increased risk of fracture. The relative risk for developing osteoporosis in women with prolactinoma was found to be 4.5, indicating that hyperprolactinemia in women is a major risk factor for osteoporosis..

70	5a733d2a2dc08e987e000015	Is Tocilizumab effective for Giant-Cell Arteritis?	Emerging evidence for adjunctive therapy with tocilizumab, methotrexate, aspirin, angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins is encouraging and may lead to a more mainstream role for these therapies among patients with GCA.  TNF-α blockers are ineffective in giant cell arteritis, while observational evidence and a phase 2 randomized trial support the use of tocilizumab in relapsing giant cell arteritis.  OBJECTIVES: Randomised-controlled trials have recently proven the efficacy of the interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab (TCZ) in giant cell arteritis (GCA).  CONCLUSIONS: TCZ may exert its therapeutic effects in GCA by increasing the proliferation and activation of Tregs, and by reverting the pathogenic Treg phenotype seen during active disease. Cyclophosphamide and tocilizumab look promising but require validation in further studies.  Therefore, tocilizumab (humanised monoclonal antibody binding the human interleukin-6 receptor) was introduced as a potential salvage therapy with a swift consecutive resolution of the systemic symptoms and stabilization of the ophthalmic lesions.CONCLUSIONS: Although a late effect of steroids pulses cannot be formally ruled out in this dramatic situation, tocilizumab likely offered a decisive effect in preventing bilateral blindness and may have contributed to steroid tapering. Tocilizumab may represent a new early effective second-line treatment option in corticosteroid-resistant anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.  Tocilizumab for giant cell arteritis with corticosteroid-resistant progressive anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab, received weekly or every other week, combined with a 26-week prednisone taper was superior to either 26-week or 52-week prednisone tapering plus placebo with regard to sustained glucocorticoid-free remission in patients with giant-cell arteritis. Longer follow-up is necessary to determine the durability of remission and safety of tocilizumab. Two RCTs have evidenced the efficacy of tocilizumab in addition to glucocorticoids (GCs) in the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA).  Recent randomized placebo-controlled trials have reported on the efficacy and safety of abatacept and mostly tocilizumab in inducing and maintaining remission of GCA.  If a biological therapy is indicated, and in light of the data discussed in this review, the first choice would be tocilizumab in GCA and anti-TNF-α agents (mainly infliximab) in TAK. CONCLUSION: TCZ is effective in GCA. TNF-α blockers are ineffective in giant cell arteritis, while observational evidence and a phase 2 randomized trial support the use of tocilizumab in relapsing giant cell arteritis. A favorable outcome was rapidly observed both on clinical and biological data allowing a corticoid therapy sparing.<br><b>CONCLUSION</b>: Tocilizumab is a promising treatment of giant cell arteritis but controlled trials are needed to confirm its efficacy.<br> <b>INTRODUCTION</b>: Treatment of giant cell arteritis is based on prolonged corticosteroid therapy but adverse side effects are common especially in the elderly.<br><b>CASE REPORTS</b>: We report three patients with giant cell vasculitis treated by tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antibody, owing to resistance or intolerance to corticosteroid therapy. Several studies have reported that tocilizumab is effective for aortitis associated with Takayasu's arteritis and giant cell arteritis. TNF-α blockers are ineffective in giant cell arteritis, while observational evidence and a phase 2 randomized trial support the use of tocilizumab in relapsing giant cell arteritis. Preliminary clinical trial data suggest that abatacept and tocilizumab reduce the risk of relapse in GCA. Tocilizumab, an effective treatment for relapsing giant cell arteritis. TNF-α blockers are ineffective in giant cell arteritis, while observational evidence and a phase 2 randomized trial support the use of tocilizumab in relapsing giant cell arteritis. Tocilizumab is a promising treatment of giant cell arteritis but controlled trials are needed to confirm its efficacy.	yes
